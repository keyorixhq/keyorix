# ADR-040: Cluster-wide login rate limiting

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-12

## Context

Login brute-force protection was an in-process, in-memory sliding window: a
`map[ip][]time.Time` in the HTTP auth handlers, capping failed attempts at 10 per
IP per 15 minutes. The HA work (ADR-039) flagged this as the one remaining
per-replica gap: with N stateless replicas behind a load balancer, the limit is
enforced *independently* on each replica, so an attacker spreading attempts across
replicas gets up to N× the budget. The recommended mitigation was a gateway/WAF,
but Keyorix should be secure-by-default on-prem without requiring one.

## Decision

Move the limiter into the database so the count is shared across replicas.

- **`login_attempts` table** (`id`, `ip`, `attempted_at`) with a composite
  `(ip, attempted_at)` index. A failed attempt inserts a row; the gate counts an
  IP's rows within the window across the whole cluster.
- **Core API** (`internal/core/rate_limit.go`): `RecordFailedLogin(ctx, ip)`,
  `IsLoginRateLimited(ctx, ip)` (count ≥ `LoginMaxAttempts=10` within
  `LoginWindow=15m`), and `PruneLoginAttempts(ctx)`. The HTTP handlers' old
  free-function limiter is replaced by thin `AuthHandler` methods that delegate
  here — every login surface (password, TOTP verify, WebAuthn second-factor, and
  passwordless) now shares one cluster-wide limit.
- **Fail-open.** A storage error in `IsLoginRateLimited` returns `false` (allow).
  Rate limiting is a *backstop* layered on the real password/passkey check, not the
  auth gate itself; a transient DB hiccup must not lock every user out. Recording
  is best-effort for the same reason.
- **Bounded growth.** An always-on, single-replica-gated (ADR-039) maintenance
  goroutine prunes rows past the window hourly, independent of the opt-in retention
  purge scheduler — the limiter table must stay bounded even when purge is off.

## Why the write volume is acceptable

A row is written only on a *failed* attempt, and the gate is checked *first*: once
an IP reaches the budget it is rejected **before** another row is recorded. So a
single attacking IP writes at most ~`LoginMaxAttempts` rows per window before being
throttled. A distributed attack writes proportionally to the number of distinct
IPs — that broad case is still best handled at the gateway (noted below), but the
common single-IP / small-botnet brute force is now bounded cluster-wide by Keyorix
itself.

## Consequences

- The limit now holds across replicas — the ADR-039 per-replica gap is closed for
  the single-IP/small-botnet case.
- Each login does one indexed `COUNT` (and a failed one, one `INSERT`). Login is
  far less frequent than secret reads, so the added DB work is negligible.
- SQLite (single instance) works identically — it is just a table.

## Deferred

A truly distributed (many-IP) brute force, and request-rate limiting in general,
are still best enforced at the load balancer / API gateway / WAF — this ADR
hardens the credential-stuffing case, it does not replace edge rate limiting.
Per-account (not just per-IP) lockout; exponential backoff; CAPTCHA challenge.

## Verification

Core tests over SQLite: an IP is allowed under the budget and blocked at it; a
different IP is unaffected; attempts age out of the window; an empty IP is never
limited; prune removes aged rows. `make build` + full suite + `go vet` green.

## Addendum (2026-07-05): closing the gap under storage.type: remote

ADR-049 lets a Keyorix server itself run with `storage.type: remote` — a chained
deployment proxying every storage call to an upstream Keyorix server over HTTP.
`RemoteStorage` originally had no server endpoint to proxy
`RecordLoginAttempt`/`CountRecentLoginAttempts`/`PruneLoginAttempts` to at all, so
this ADR's rate limiter was a silent, permanent no-op for the whole life of the
process under that backend (#452); a later round (#675) closed the *silent* half by
logging a loud one-time operator warning, but left the underlying gap itself open,
deliberately deferred pending further investigation into whether a real proxied
endpoint was actually achievable without a disproportionate new authorization model.

It was: the upstream API a `RemoteStorage` client already authenticates against for
every other proxied call (full user CRUD, secret CRUD, ...) requires a credential
with far broader privilege than "record/count an IP's recent login attempts" would
ever need, so three new endpoints —
`POST /api/v1/system/login-attempts`,
`GET /api/v1/system/login-attempts/count`,
`POST /api/v1/system/login-attempts/prune` — were added
(`server/http/handlers/login_attempts_proxy.go`, registered in
`server/http/router.go`), gated on the same pre-existing `system.read`/
`system.write` RBAC permissions every other admin-level route in this codebase
already uses. They are thin passthroughs onto this ADR's own
`login_attempts` table via `storage.Storage`'s primitives — no rate-limiting policy
decision is made server-side; the calling server's own `internal/core.KeyorixCore`
still decides the threshold/window, exactly as it does against a local backend.
`RemoteStorage.RecordLoginAttempt`/`CountRecentLoginAttempts`/`PruneLoginAttempts`
(`internal/storage/store/remote_login_attempts.go`) now make real HTTP calls
instead of stubbing out.

A downstream server's forwarded IP shares one cluster-wide budget per key with the
upstream's own direct end-user traffic for that same key (both use the identical
table/columns password-reset rate limiting already shares via its `pwreset:` key
prefix) — the same abusive client IP hitting either front door is the same abuse,
not a conflation of unrelated data.

Verified end-to-end against the REAL production router (not a protocol mock):
`server/http/remote_storage_login_rate_limit_test.go` builds an "upstream" via the
actual `NewRouter`, points a real `store.RemoteStorage` at it as a "downstream"
server's storage, and drives repeated failed logins through
`core.KeyorixCore.RecordFailedLogin`/`IsLoginRateLimited` to prove the Nth attempt is
genuinely throttled.

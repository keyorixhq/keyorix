# FINDING: vacuous-empty-collection and branch-restricted authority ceilings (F6 follow-on sweep)

**Date:** 2026-09-22 (branch `fix/system-proxy-sweep-g3`, based on `origin/main`
after #1968/#1969/#1970).
**Component:** `internal/core/authz.go` (`requireGranterHoldsRolePermissions`),
`internal/core/users.go` (`ValidateRoleGrantAuthority`),
`internal/core/membership_lifecycle.go` (`TransitionMembership`), 9
`server/http/handlers/*_proxy.go` call sites (machine-tagging fix),
`server/http/handlers/groups_proxy.go` (`AddGroupMemberProxy`/
`RemoveGroupMemberProxy`), `server/http/handlers/invitations_proxy.go`
(`CreateInvitationProxy`'s own baseline), and
`server/http/system_write_ceiling_walk_test.go` (the F6 allowlist).
**Status:** source-level fix landed; **8 of 8** probe-confirmed route gaps
closed (6 by the source fix alone; `AddGroupMemberProxy` and
`RemoveGroupMemberProxy` needed their own handler-level fix, landed here —
`AddGroupMemberProxy`'s was mis-scoped as Medium in an earlier pass of this
same review; see severity correction below). 3 stale/false walk-allowlist
entries corrected, plus a 4th reclassification (`RemoveGroupMemberProxy`
moved out of the allowlist into `systemCeilingDenyChecked` now that it
requires more than blanket `system.write`). Full repo test suite green
(`go build ./...`, `go test ./internal/... ./server/... ./cmd/...`).

## Summary

The 13-route reconciliation against `origin/main` (this branch's earlier
message) found 8 routes where a caller-authority ceiling was reachable but
either absent or structurally skippable. Investigating the root cause instead
of patching each route individually found this is a **bug class**, not 8
unrelated bugs: two distinct shapes where a `Require*`/`Validate*` authority
check is written correctly for the common case but silently never runs for an
edge-case input, and a caller inherits whatever ceiling *should* have applied
by default instead of being refused.

**Shape (a) — empty-collection loop returns nil.** A check that walks a
collection (a role's own bundled permissions, a set of grants) and returns
`nil`/`true` only from inside the loop body never gets a chance to refuse
anything when the collection is empty — an attacker who can make the
collection empty (grant a permission-less role; supply a role-less request)
gets the same "nothing to check, so allowed" outcome a genuinely-safe empty
input would get, except here the caller's OWN authority was never verified at
all.

**Shape (b) — authority check nested in one branch of a state/kind switch.**
A function handling several legal transitions/kinds runs its authority check
only inside the branch someone thought to add it to (e.g. "activating a
membership is the dangerous case"), while sibling branches reach the exact
same underlying write with zero caller-authority check — gated only by
whatever *legality* check (is this transition allowed at all) happens to run
unconditionally. Legality is not authority; a reviewer skimming "the
state-machine check runs for every transition" can read that as blanket
safety when it isn't.

## Source-level fix

Per the explicit instruction to fix the vacuity at the source rather than
patch every call site: `requireGranterHoldsRolePermissions` (`authz.go`) now
requires a `roles.assign` baseline **before** the per-permission loop, via a
new `checkGranterHoldsPermission` helper shared with the loop body itself. The
per-permission loop was split into `requireGranterHoldsRolePermissionsNoBaseline`,
reserved for exactly one documented, principled exception:
`CreateUserWithAssignments`/`InviteGlobal`'s mandatory, non-discretionary
`system_viewer` default when no system role was explicitly requested (mirrors
plain `CreateUser`'s own unconditional auto-assign, gated by `users.write`
alone — not a second instance of the bug, a deliberate carve-out with its own
existing test coverage). `ValidateRoleGrantAuthority` (`users.go`) got the
identical `users.write`-baseline treatment for the analogous grant-set shape.
`TransitionMembership` (`membership_lifecycle.go`) had its `roles.assign`
check moved from inside the `to==MembershipActive` branch to run
unconditionally before the transition switch, with the role-specific ceiling
for activation layered on top as before.

### Sweep table

Repo-wide sweep of every `Require*/Validate*/Authorize*` on `KeyorixCore` for
both shapes (`internal/core/*.go`, non-test):

| Function | Shape | Hit? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `requireGranterHoldsRolePermissions`/`NoBaseline` | (a) | Yes | **Fixed** — baseline added |
| `ValidateRoleGrantAuthority` | (a) | Yes | **Fixed** — baseline added |
| `TransitionMembership` | (b) | Yes | **Fixed** — baseline moved outside `to==Active` |
| `validateGroupJoinRoles` | (a)-shaped | No — correct by design | Empty grants means the group confers nothing; the per-grant loop calling the now-fixed baseline closes the "group HAS grants" case. The gap here is a different one — see Still Open below. |
| `requireNoSoDViolation` + 4 siblings (`sod.go`) | (a)-shaped | No — different semantics | These detect forbidden PERMISSION PAIRS; empty input genuinely contains no pairs. Not an authority baseline being skipped. |
| `resolveAndAuthorizePermissions` (role-bundling, `handlers/rbac.go`) | (a)-shaped | No | Router-level `RequirePermission(roles.write)` gates both callers (`CreateRole`/`UpdateRole`) before this runs; no `/system` proxy bypasses it. |
| `requireGlobalAdminToReinstateAdminRoles` | (a)-shaped | No | Correctly no-ops only when the role SET contains no admin-tier role, not "empty means safe." |
| `TransitionMachineIdentity` | (b)-shaped | No core-level ceiling at all | Structurally different from `TransitionMembership`: relies entirely on router-level `RequireScopedPermission(roles.assign)` on its one caller route; the `/system` machine-transition proxy uses a separately-reviewed conditional-write path (`storage.TransitionMachineIdentityState` directly, not this function). Single point of trust, not a branch gap. |
| `InviteGlobal`/`CreateUserWithAssignments`'s `systemRole==""` branch | (b)-shaped | No | Both branches call an authority check (`NoBaseline` for the mandatory default, full baseline otherwise) — the principled exception above, not an unguarded sibling. |

## 8 probe-confirmed route gaps — re-run after the source fix

Each probe sends the request as a `system.write`-only caller (no
`roles.assign` anywhere) and asserts refusal + no state change.

| Route | Closed by source fix alone? | Status | Impact | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CreateInvitationProxy` | No — needed its own unconditional `roles.assign` baseline (the 3 per-field checks were each gated on that field being non-empty; all-empty skipped every one) | **Fixed** this branch | Plants a `pending` project-invitation row to an arbitrary email with zero authority. Acceptance cannot actually succeed: `inviteMemberWithMode` refuses an empty role (`"a project role is required"`), so no membership/privilege is ever granted — the account gets created, then the grant step fails and the invitation is left pending, not accepted. Bounded to invitation-list pollution and a plausible phishing vector (a real-looking pending invite to an arbitrary address), not privilege escalation. | **Medium** (state pollution / social-engineering surface, not escalation) |
| `UpdateAccessRequestProxy` (approve, no-secret/role-only branch) | **Yes** | Closed | Approving a role-only access request now requires `roles.assign` at the target project even when the suggested role bundles zero permissions. | **Medium-High** (pre-fix: any `system.write` caller could approve access-review-adjacent grants in any project) |
| `CreateAccessRequestApprovalProxy` (same branch) | **Yes** | Closed | Same mechanism, same fix. | **Medium-High** |
| `CreateMembershipProxy` | **Yes** (source fix) + machine-caller tagging fix | Closed | Creating a project membership with a permission-less role now requires `roles.assign` at the target project. | **Medium-High** |
| `TransitionMembershipProxy` | **Yes** (source fix) + machine-caller tagging fix | Closed | Every transition (not just `active`) now requires `roles.assign` at the membership's project — `active->revoked`, `provisioned->revoked`, `identity_verified->provisioned` previously had zero authority check, gated only by state-machine legality. An active membership carrying a zero-permission role grants no RBAC-checked capability on its own (permissions are resolved from the role's bundle, which is empty) — the exploitable value pre-fix was in the CEILING being skippable, not in what a zero-permission role itself confers. | **High** (any `system.write` caller could revoke/transition any project's memberships) |
| `CreateUserWithRoleGrantsProxy` | **Yes** (source fix) + machine-caller tagging fix | Closed | `ValidateRoleGrantAuthority` now requires `users.write` unconditionally. A new account created with empty/zero-permission grants can authenticate but holds no RBAC-checked capability anywhere (a "shell" account) — the exploit's real value pre-fix was bypassing the creator's own authority requirement, not minting a privileged account directly; a subsequent, separately-authorized role grant to that account is a normal, already-gated operation. | **Medium-High** |
| `AddGroupMemberProxy` | No | **Fixed** this branch | **Severity correction:** an earlier pass of this review called this "Medium (any system.write caller can add arbitrary users to any group)" — that undersold it. `editor`/`project_developer`, the most powerful **non-admin-tier** default roles, both grant `secrets.read` + `secrets.write` + `secrets.delete` (`auth_bootstrap.go`'s `editorPermissions`/`defaultRoles`) — full read/write/delete over the crown-jewel resource. Group role grants are inherited by every member (`GetUserGroupRoleIDsAt`; `validateGroupJoinRoles`'s own doc: "joining a group confers EVERY role the group holds"), and assigning a role to a group instead of individual users is a normal, expected team-management pattern, not a contrived edge case. Pre-fix, a caller holding only `system.write` — documented as grantable to a narrow, unrelated custom role (audit checkpoints, legal holds, risk exceptions, SoD policies, admin job triggers) — could add itself or an accomplice account to ANY existing group, including one already holding `editor`/`project_developer`, and walk away with full secrets read/write/delete on that group's scope. This **is** a direct privilege grant, not a "confers nothing" case. `core.AddUserToGroup`'s own ceiling (`validateGroupJoinRoles`) only fires when the group HAS grants (correct at that layer — the source fix's baseline already closes that case), but nothing mirrored the human-facing route's UNCONDITIONAL `roles.assign` requirement (`RequirePermission(permRolesAssign)`, global scope, router.go) for a role-LESS group, which is exactly the gap that made the direct escalation reachable via any ALREADY-privileged group regardless of whether IT specifically has grants at add-time. **Fix:** added the same unconditional `roles.assign`-at-global-scope check the human-facing route already requires, via the existing `requireGroupsProxyRolesAssign` helper (already used by `RestoreGroupProxy` in the same file). | **Critical** (direct privilege escalation to full secrets read/write/delete via any existing role-bearing group, no `roles.assign` required) |
| `RemoveGroupMemberProxy` | No | **Fixed** this branch | `core.RemoveUserFromGroup` has no actor-authority ceiling at all by design (target-state guards only, same "removal confers nothing" reasoning as `RemoveMachineRoleProxy`) — but the human-facing route still requires `roles.assign` at global scope unconditionally. Pre-fix, a `system.write`-only caller could silently detach any user from any group — including revoking that user's ONLY path to `secrets.read`/`write`/`delete` if the group holds `editor`/`project_developer`. Not privilege escalation (removal grants nothing), but a real, targeted denial capability: the removed member cannot self-recover, only re-adding them (which itself now requires `roles.assign`, closing the loop) restores the access. **Fix:** same `requireGroupsProxyRolesAssign` check, mirroring the human-facing route. | **Medium** (targeted, repeatable access-denial/tampering capability, not escalation — but real, live access is actually lost, not merely at-risk) |

## Walk allowlist corrections

`server/http/system_write_ceiling_walk_test.go`'s `systemCeilingAllowlist`
contained 3 entries whose prose no longer matched (or never fully matched)
the code:

1. **`POST /api/v1/system/invitations`** — claimed the per-field checks alone
   were sufficient; they were each gated on their own field being non-empty,
   so the all-empty case ran none of them. Corrected to describe the new
   unconditional baseline, cites `TestG3Probe_CreateInvitationProxy_SystemWriteOnly_CreatesRoleLessInvitation`.
2. **`PUT /api/v1/system/project-memberships/{id}/transition`** — described
   only the state-machine *legality* check as protection, which read as
   blanket safety but was never an authority claim; the real authority
   ceiling was `to==Active`-only pre-fix. Corrected to say so explicitly,
   cites `TestConformance_TransitionProjectMembershipState`.
3. **`POST /api/v1/system/project-memberships`** — the `roles.assign`
   re-derivation it cited was real for a human caller but unreachable for a
   genuine machine caller (missing `WithSelfMachineGranter` tagging).
   Corrected, cites `TestConformance_CreateProjectMembership`.
4. **`DELETE /api/v1/system/groups/{id}/members/{userId}`** (`RemoveGroupMemberProxy`)
   — was classified in `systemCeilingAllowlist` ("no ceiling, removal is the
   safe direction"). That reasoning is no longer true: this route now
   requires `roles.assign`, more than blanket `system.write`. Moved to
   `systemCeilingDenyChecked` (a dedicated `Test*` proving refusal —
   `TestG3Probe_RemoveGroupMemberProxy_SystemWriteOnly_RemovesMemberFromOrdinaryGroup`
   — is the walk's requirement for that bucket, already satisfied).
   `systemCeilingUnverifiedRatchet` lowered from 41 to 40 accordingly (one
   fewer `unverified` entry now that this route left the allowlist
   entirely).

## Allowlist verification schema (Step 3)

`systemCeilingAllowlist`'s value type changed from a bare `string` reason to
`systemCeilingAllowlistEntry{reason, test, unverified}`. Every remaining
entry (43, after `RemoveGroupMemberProxy` left the allowlist entirely — see
correction 4 above) sets exactly one of `test` (names a real `Test*` function
in the package, existence enforced by
`TestSystemCeilingAllowlistVerificationRatchet` via `go/parser` over the
package's own `*_test.go` files — a citation naming a function that doesn't
exist fails outright) or `unverified` (prose only, explicitly counted).
Current split: **3 verified, 40 unverified**. `systemCeilingUnverifiedRatchet
= 40` is the ceiling on the unverified count — a brand-new allowlist entry
cannot set `unverified` without either citing a real test or an existing
entry being converted to make room, since that would push the count over the
ratchet and fail the test. Red-proofed both failure modes directly (a fake
entry pushing the count over the ratchet; a `test:` citation naming a
nonexistent function) before removing the fake entry and confirming green.

The remaining 40 unverified entries are **not** converted on this branch — per
instruction, that's left to a future mixed-principal authority fuzzer (noted
in the walk file's own doc comment) rather than ~40 hand-written near-identical
tests. Each future conversion should lower `systemCeilingUnverifiedRatchet` by
one in the same commit.

## Second-order fix: machine-caller tagging gap (discovered via this sweep)

Fixing the source-level vacuity exposed that several `/system` proxy handlers
never tag `WithSelfMachineGranter` before calling into a now-baseline-checked
core function — for a genuine machine caller (not a relay), the baseline was
reachable but structurally unsatisfiable (`actorIsMachine` with no tag falls
through to an unconditional `false, nil` refusal in `checkGranterHoldsPermission`).
This is a false-refusal/availability defect for a legitimately-permissioned
machine caller, not an escalation — confirmed via each route's conceptually
equivalent, already-correctly-tagged core function (`InviteToProject`,
`ApproveAccessRequestWithExpiry`). Fixed in 9 handlers, each verified against
its own conformance test: `CreateInvitationProxy`, `UpdateAccessRequestProxy`,
`CreateAccessRequestApprovalProxy`, `TransitionMembershipProxy`,
`CreateMembershipProxy`, `CreateUserWithRoleGrantsProxy`,
`AssignRoleWithExpiryProxy`, `AssignRoleToGroupWithExpiryProxy`,
`AssignMachineRoleProxy`.

## Verification

- Branch rebased onto current `origin/main` (fast-forwarded; no local commits
  existed to replay, so no conflict risk) before this final verification pass.
- `go build ./...`: clean.
- `go vet ./server/http/...`: clean.
- `go test ./server/http/...`: green, 0 failed, 0 unexpected skips.
- `go test ./internal/... ./server/... ./cmd/...`: green, 0 failed, full repo.
- All 9 G3 probe tests independently confirmed passing, including
  `TestG3Probe_AddGroupMemberProxy_SystemWriteOnly_AddsMemberToOrdinaryGroup`
  and `TestG3Probe_RemoveGroupMemberProxy_SystemWriteOnly_RemovesMemberFromOrdinaryGroup`
  (previously red, now fixed and green).
- `TestSystemCeilingAllowlistVerificationRatchet` red-proofed both ways
  (ratchet-exceeded, missing-test-citation) before landing green; logs
  "allowlist: 3 verified, 40 unverified (ratchet 40)".
- 5 test fixtures across `groups_s13_test.go`/`handlers_s23_test.go`/`handlers_s35_test.go`
  needed the established repair (an authenticated actor holding the new
  ceiling's permission, or — for the two DB-error tests — migrated to the
  `TestRestoreGroupProxy_DBError_S35` SQL-trigger-isolation pattern so the
  500 is proven to come from the targeted write, not the new auth check).

## Not yet done (for review before deciding next steps)

- Per-route commits (one per route, probe as regression test + control case) —
  everything above is currently uncommitted on this branch.
- The remaining 40 unverified allowlist entries (deferred to the fuzzer per
  instruction).
- `docs/security-closures.tsv` rows — deferred to after merge, keyed to the
  merge SHA, per instruction (not part of this PR).

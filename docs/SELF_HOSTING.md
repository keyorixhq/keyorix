# Self-Hosting Keyorix

Keyorix runs entirely on your own infrastructure — no cloud dependency, no
outbound telemetry. This guide covers a Docker Compose deployment (web UI + API
server + PostgreSQL), the production concerns that actually matter (encryption
keys, backups, upgrades, TLS), and how to recover.

The stack is three containers:

| Service    | Image                              | Purpose                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `web`      | `ghcr.io/keyorixhq/keyorix-web`    | nginx serving the SPA; reverse-proxies `/api/`, `/auth/`, `/system/` to the API |
| `backend`  | `ghcr.io/keyorixhq/keyorix-server` | the Keyorix API server (Go, single binary) |
| `postgres` | `postgres:15-alpine`               | the encrypted data store                 |

## 1. Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+ and the Compose plugin (`docker compose version`).
- A host with at least 1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM for a small team.

## 2. Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/keyorixhq/keyorix.git
cd keyorix
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set strong values (see below). Then:
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8088** and log in with the admin credentials you set in
`.env`. That's it.

> Building from source instead of pulling published images: edit
> `docker-compose.yml` and swap the `backend` service's `image:` for the
> commented-out `build:` block.

**Generate your admin recovery key now, before you need it.** If every admin
account is ever locked out (lost password, lost MFA device), the only way back
in is `keyorix-server admin recover-admin` on the server host — and by
default it also requires this key (`security.recover_admin.insecure_keyless_admin_recovery`, formerly
`keyless_mode`, is an
explicit, less-secure opt-out documented in `configs/keyorix.yaml.tpl`, not the
default, `security.recover_admin.insecure_keyless_admin_recovery: true` in server config opts
out). No key exists until you generate one. Like every `keyorix-server admin`
command except a Postgres backup, it needs the database to itself — it holds
the exclusive admin lock for the whole rotation, so a concurrent
`recover-admin` can never see a half-rotated key, and it refuses while the
server is running. Stop `backend`, run it in a throwaway container, start
`backend` again (a few seconds of downtime):

```sh
docker compose stop backend
docker compose run --rm backend ./keyorix-server admin recovery-key rotate
docker compose start backend
```

This prints a 256-bit key **exactly once** — save it somewhere durable and
separate from this host (a password manager, not a file next to `.env`). It is
never written to a log file or the audit chain in plaintext, and losing it
means running the command again (which invalidates the old key). See
`docs/design-b2-recover-admin.md` for the full design.

## 3. Configuration (`.env`)

All secrets come from `.env` — there are **no baked-in default passwords**; the
stack refuses to start if the required ones are missing. Generate strong values
with `openssl rand -base64 32`.

| Variable                  | Required | Notes |
|---------------------------|----------|-------|
| `KEYORIX_DB_PASSWORD`     | ✅       | PostgreSQL password (shared by `postgres` and `backend`). |
| `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` | ✅       | Passphrase the encryption KEK is derived from. **See the warning below.** |
| `KEYORIX_ADMIN_PASSWORD`  | optional | If set, the first admin is created on first boot (idempotent). Leave blank to run `keyorix-server admin init` manually on the server host. |
| `KEYORIX_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` | required if `KEYORIX_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set | `/system/init` always requires a matching bootstrap token. Setting `KEYORIX_ADMIN_PASSWORD` without this silently skips admin creation (a WARN is logged, but the container still reports healthy). |
| `KEYORIX_ADMIN_USERNAME`  | optional | Defaults to `admin`. |
| `KEYORIX_ADMIN_EMAIL`     | optional | Defaults to `admin@keyorix.local`. |

Server configuration (storage, encryption paths, ports) lives in
`keyorix.docker.yaml`, mounted read-only into the `backend` container. The full,
annotated reference is `configs/keyorix.yaml.tpl`.

## 4. ⚠️ The master password and encryption keys — read this

Secrets are encrypted with a Data Encryption Key (DEK) that is itself wrapped by
a Key Encryption Key (KEK) **derived from `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD`**. The wrapped
DEK and the KEK salt live on the `keyorix_keys` Docker volume.

Two ways to permanently lose every stored secret:

1. **Changing `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD`** after first boot. The KEK no longer
   derives, the DEK can't be unwrapped. (To rotate it intentionally, use
   `keyorix-server admin encryption rotate-kek` — never by editing `.env`.)
2. **Losing the `keyorix_keys` volume.** Back it up (next section).

### DEK rotation procedure

To generate a new Data Encryption Key and re-encrypt every secret in the database:

```sh
# 1. Stop the server (rotation acquires an exclusive lock; it refuses if the
#    server process is running and holding the key lock).
docker compose stop backend

# 2. Preview what will be re-encrypted — no changes made, no --confirm needed.
docker compose run --rm backend ./keyorix-server admin encryption rotate --dry-run

# 3. Perform the rotation.  --confirm is required (acknowledges write-lock).
docker compose run --rm backend ./keyorix-server admin encryption rotate --confirm

# 4. Restart the server.
docker compose start backend
```

The rotation re-encrypts all secrets, credentials, and session tokens in a
single transaction.  If the server crashes mid-sweep, the orphaned pending key
file is detected and cleaned up automatically on the next `--confirm` run.
Back up the `keyorix_keys` volume after a successful rotation.

Store `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` in your own password manager / secret store. It is
not recoverable from the system.

## 5. Backup and restore

A complete backup is **two** things — the database *and* the encryption keys.
Neither alone is sufficient: the DB without the keys is unreadable ciphertext;
the keys without the DB are useless.

`keyorix-server admin backup --output <path>` / `admin restore --input <path>`
bundle both into one archive, on **either** storage backend — SQLite or
Postgres. Unlike a raw `pg_dump`/SQLite-file copy, the archive is
authenticated (HMAC-signed, KEK-derived key, `docs/design-b3-backup-v2.md`
§5) and its checksums catch corruption (a bad copy, a truncated transfer, bit
rot); tampering is a different property a checksum alone can't provide, since
anyone with write access to the archive can recompute one to match — so
`admin restore` also runs `admin verify-audit` automatically against the
restored database and fails if it reports the audit chain BROKEN. Also record
`KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` separately (it is required to derive the KEK that
unwraps the backed-up DEK).

**Backup** (run inside the `backend` container, against whichever storage
this stack is configured for):

```sh
docker compose exec backend ./keyorix-server admin backup --output /tmp/backup.tar.gz
docker compose cp backend:/tmp/backup.tar.gz ./keyorix-backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz
```

On Postgres, this reads through a single `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot
transaction by default — every table sees the identical point-in-time view,
without taking the database offline, so it runs beside the live `backend`
exactly as shown. The key files are read under the key-rotation read lock
(no `rotate`/`rotate-kek`/`migrate-provider` can change them, or re-encrypt
rows, until the backup's reads are done) and re-checked afterwards; if a key
rotation is in progress or the key files changed mid-backup, the command
fails and leaves no archive — retry it. Pass `--exclusive` instead to take
the same host-level exclusive lock a SQLite backup always holds, if you'd
rather trade availability for that stronger guarantee: that needs the
database to itself, so stop the `backend` service first and use
`docker compose run --rm backend ...` as for restore below.

On **SQLite** (single binary, `QUICK_START.md`), a backup always needs the
database to itself: stop the server, run `keyorix-server admin backup
--output <path>`, start it again. A backup beside a live SQLite server is
refused rather than taken inconsistently.

**Restore** (with the *same* `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` and the same storage
config the backup was taken from). `admin restore` always takes this
database's own exclusive lock and refuses if a live server already holds it
— stop the `backend` service first, and run restore via `docker compose run`
(a fresh, throwaway container) rather than `exec` (which needs an already-
running one):

```sh
docker compose stop backend
docker compose cp ./keyorix-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz backend:/tmp/backup.tar.gz
docker compose run --rm backend ./keyorix-server admin restore --input /tmp/backup.tar.gz
docker compose up -d backend
```

Restore refuses a non-empty target by default (`--overwrite-existing` to
proceed anyway on a genuine disaster-recovery restore) — the normal flow is
restoring into a fresh database, not overwriting a live one.

**Manual `pg_dump`/`psql`** is still a reasonable choice if you already have
a Postgres backup pipeline built around it and don't need the archive's
built-in authentication/audit-verification — it works exactly as before:

```sh
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U keyorix keyorix | gzip > keyorix-db-$(date +%F).sql.gz
# Encryption keys (the keyorix_keys volume). The example below assumes your
# Compose project is named "keyorix" (true for a plain `git clone .../keyorix`
# checkout run from that directory) -- Compose prefixes every named volume
# with the project name, so the actual volume is <project>_keyorix_keys. If
# your checkout directory has a different name, or you set
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME explicitly, run `docker volume ls | grep keyorix_keys`
# first and substitute the real name below (verified against a real
# non-"keyorix"-named checkout: ADR-109 step 6, B7 runbook validation).
docker run --rm -v keyorix_keyorix_keys:/keys -v "$PWD":/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/keyorix-keys-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /keys .
```

To restore a manual dump (into a fresh stack, with the *same* `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD`):

```sh
docker compose up -d postgres
gunzip -c keyorix-db-YYYY-MM-DD.sql.gz | docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U keyorix keyorix
# Same volume-naming caveat as the backup step above.
docker run --rm -v keyorix_keyorix_keys:/keys -v "$PWD":/backup alpine \
  tar xzf /backup/keyorix-keys-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz -C /keys
docker compose up -d
```

Verified end to end (ADR-109 step 6, B7): a fresh Postgres-backed stack, real
secret write, `pg_dump`/keys-volume backup, full teardown (`docker compose
down -v`), restore into fresh volumes via `psql`/keys-volume-extract, and
`keyorix-server admin verify-audit` reporting `VALID` against the restored
database — the secret value round-tripped correctly and the audit chain
carried across the dump/restore boundary intact.

### Moving from SQLite to Postgres

`admin restore` doesn't care which backend a backup came from — only which
one the *target* config points at. Take a backup from a SQLite (single-binary)
deployment, point a fresh config at a Postgres database instead, and restore
into it: same command, same code path as any other restore, no separate
migration tool or conversion step (`docs/design-b3-backup-v2.md` §8). This
works directly for any archive a v2-writing binary produced (every release
from the one that introduced this backup format onward). An archive from an
*older* release that only ever wrote the v1 (physical, SQLite-only) format
can only restore into SQLite — restore it there first with the current
binary (which also upgrades its schema), take a fresh backup of that, and
restore *that* into Postgres.

### Version-skipping upgrades

The same property makes skipping releases safe: `admin restore` always
migrates its target to the current schema *before* loading any row, so a
backup taken on an old release restores cleanly on a much newer one in one
step, with no per-version upgrade path to walk through manually. Test it as
a drill before relying on it in production: back up on the old release, spin
up the new release against a fresh database/config, restore, and confirm
`admin verify-audit` reports VALID and a known secret still decrypts to the
expected value.

**Restoring an older backup than this host has already progressed past is
refused by default.** Restoring genuinely can undo history: any revocation
that happened *after* the backup was taken (a suspended account, a deleted
machine credential, a rotated role grant) doesn't exist in that backup's
database, so restoring it silently un-revokes that access. `admin restore`
compares the archive's own certified audit-trail progress against a
host-local witness file (`.audit-highwater-witness`, sibling to the
database, maintained automatically by every server this host runs) *before*
writing anything to disk, and refuses if the archive is behind. This is a
genuine, host-local-only check — it protects against restoring a stale
backup back onto ITS OWN host, but a fresh replacement host (or one whose
data directory, witness file included, was wiped) has nothing to compare
against and cannot be protected by this mechanism alone (see
`docs/design-b3-backup-v2.md` §6.5's stated limitation; a stronger,
externally-anchored check independent of the restoring host's own state is
designed in §6.4 but not yet implemented).

For a genuine disaster-recovery restore of an intentionally older backup,
pass `--allow-rollback`. This proceeds, but writes an explicit audit event
to the restored database (once its chain is writable again) recording how
many events behind the restore went — there is no silent, warning-only
path.

## 6. Upgrades

```sh
docker compose pull          # fetch newer published images
docker compose up -d         # recreate with the new images
```

Schema migrations run automatically on boot and are additive. **Back up first**
(section 5). To pin a version instead of `latest`, set the image tags in
`docker-compose.yml` to a release tag (e.g. `:v0.3.0`).

## 7. TLS

The default stack serves plain HTTP on `8088`. Two ways to get HTTPS:

**Bundled (recommended) — the `tls` profile.** An optional Caddy front-end that
terminates TLS and proxies to the web container:

```sh
# In .env, set KEYORIX_DOMAIN to your real domain (DNS must point here, and
# ports 80 + 443 must be reachable from the internet for the ACME challenge):
#   KEYORIX_DOMAIN=keyorix.example.com
docker compose --profile tls up -d
```

Caddy automatically provisions and renews a publicly-trusted certificate
(Let's Encrypt / ZeroSSL). Issued certs persist on the `caddy_data` volume so
restarts don't re-request them. For a `localhost` value Caddy uses its internal
CA (browsers warn unless you trust Caddy's root). When running the `tls` profile,
don't also expose web's `8088` publicly — front everything through Caddy on
80/443.

**Your own proxy.** Or terminate TLS at an existing Caddy/Traefik/nginx/LB in
front of the `web` container: point it at `web:80` and forward
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`.

The single-binary `keyorix-server` also supports TLS directly
(`server.http.tls` in the config) for non-Docker deployments.

## 8. Metrics (Prometheus)

The backend exposes Prometheus metrics at **`GET /metrics`** (unauthenticated by
design — keep it inside your perimeter, don't expose it publicly). It includes Go
runtime + process collectors and per-route HTTP metrics
(`keyorix_http_requests_total`, `keyorix_http_request_duration_seconds`). Point
your own Prometheus at `backend:8080/metrics`.

### Background scheduler health

The periodic jobs (anomaly detection, retention purge, auto-rotation,
certificate-expiry scan, audit checkpoints, …) each export their own health, labelled
by `scheduler`:

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `keyorix_scheduler_runs_total{scheduler,outcome}` | counter | Ticks by outcome: `success`, `failure`, or `skipped`. |
| `keyorix_scheduler_run_duration_seconds{scheduler}` | histogram | Duration of ticks that actually ran (success or failure). |
| `keyorix_scheduler_last_run_timestamp_seconds{scheduler}` | gauge | Unix time of the last tick that ran. |
| `keyorix_scheduler_last_success_timestamp_seconds{scheduler}` | gauge | Unix time of the last **successful** tick. |

`skipped` is normal, not an error: in an HA deployment only one replica holds the
single-writer advisory lock (ADR-039) per tick, so the others skip — and a job can
also stand itself down (e.g. an active legal hold pauses a purge). Alert on a job that
has stopped *succeeding*, e.g.:

```
time() - keyorix_scheduler_last_success_timestamp_seconds{scheduler="auto_rotation"} > 3600
```

or, for a job that has never once succeeded since boot,
`absent(keyorix_scheduler_last_success_timestamp_seconds{scheduler="auto_rotation"})`.
Only enabled schedulers appear; the gauges are absent until a job first runs.

### Notification delivery

Every notification channel (webhook, Slack, Teams, email) exports its delivery health
under a shared `channel` label, so a wedged or failing destination is visible rather
than buried in logs:

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `keyorix_notify_deliveries_total{channel,outcome}` | counter | Deliveries by channel (`webhook`/`slack`/`teams`/`email`) and terminal outcome: `delivered`, `failed` (a permanent error or retries exhausted), or `dropped` (the bounded queue was full). |
| `keyorix_notify_delivery_retries_total{channel}` | counter | Retries made after a transient failure (a 5xx / 429 for HTTP channels, an SMTP/transport error for email). |

Transient failures are retried with exponential backoff; permanent ones (a `4xx`, a bad
address) are not retried. A rising `failed`/`dropped` rate means a destination is
unhealthy or too slow — alert on
`rate(keyorix_notify_deliveries_total{outcome=~"failed|dropped"}[5m]) > 0`.

### SIEM audit forwarding

When SIEM forwarding is enabled, the audit-event forwarder (Splunk HEC / Datadog /
webhook) exports the same delivery health — losing audit events silently is a SOC 2 /
ISO 27001 finding, so a wedged or failing SIEM should page:

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `keyorix_siem_forwards_total{outcome}` | counter | Forwards by terminal outcome: `delivered`, `failed` (a 4xx or retries exhausted), or `dropped` (the bounded queue was full). |
| `keyorix_siem_forward_retries_total` | counter | Forwards retried after a transient (5xx / 429 / transport) failure. |

Transient failures retry with exponential backoff; `4xx` is permanent. Alert on
`rate(keyorix_siem_forwards_total{outcome=~"failed|dropped"}[5m]) > 0` — a SIEM that is
dropping or failing audit events is a compliance gap.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| `KEYORIX_DB_PASSWORD is required` on `up` | No `.env`, or the required vars are blank. `cp .env.example .env` and fill them in. |
| Backend logs `password authentication failed` | The `postgres_data` volume was initialised with a different password. For a *new* install, `docker compose down -v` and start fresh (this wipes data — only for a clean install). |
| Backend can't decrypt secrets after a change | `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` changed or the `keyorix_keys` volume was lost. Restore both from backup (section 5). |
| Login returns 404 | Reverse proxy not forwarding `/auth/` — Keyorix serves login at the root path, not under `/api/`. The bundled `web` image already handles this. |
| Server refuses to start: `database schema epoch N is newer than this binary's schema epoch M` (multi-replica deployments only — see [ADR-039](adr-039-ha-deployment.md); the bundled Helm chart is pinned to 1 replica and cannot hit this) | Two possible causes, and the message can't tell them apart on its own — check the "recorded at ... ago" timestamp in the log line against your own rollout: **(a) rolling upgrade in progress** — a sibling replica already migrated to the new schema epoch, and this pod is still running the old binary. Expected and self-resolving: this pod will be replaced by the new image (or crash-loop briefly) until the rollout completes, then it stops recurring. This repo does not orchestrate that rollout for you (see ADR-039). **(b) genuine downgrade** — this binary was rolled back against a schema a newer version already migrated. Upgrade this binary to match, or restore a backup taken before the newer version ran. The server deliberately refuses to start rather than guess which case applies — see [ADR-097](adr-097-schema-epoch-downgrade-guard.md) and [ADR-101](adr-101-schema-epoch-compatibility-floor.md). |

## 10. Single-binary / air-gapped deployment

For environments where Docker isn't available, `keyorix-server` is a single Go
binary that runs against any PostgreSQL with `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` +
`KEYORIX_DB_PASSWORD` set — and it can serve the **web dashboard from the binary
itself**, so the whole product is one file plus a database. No web container, no
nginx.

```sh
make build-ui      # builds web/ (the dashboard, ADR-070) and embeds it into
                   # bin/keyorix-server
KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD=… KEYORIX_DB_PASSWORD=… ./bin/keyorix-server
```

Copy `keyorix-server` to the target host, point it at PostgreSQL, and the API +
UI are served on one port (default 8080). Set TLS directly via `server.http.tls`
in the config for HTTPS without a proxy.

`make build` (without the UI) produces an API-only binary that serves a small
placeholder page in place of the dashboard — use `make build-ui` for the full
single-file deployment.

# Keyorix configuration reference

This is the operator reference for `keyorix.yaml`. Every block is optional unless
noted; an absent block uses the documented default. Secrets (DB password, master
passphrase, SIEM/SMTP tokens) should come from **environment variables**, not the
file — see [Environment variables](#environment-variables).

The config file is located via, in order: an explicit path argument, then
`KEYORIX_CONFIG_PATH`, then `keyorix.yaml` in the working directory.

## Environment variables

Sensitive values are read from the environment when set, overriding any value in
the file:

| Variable | Used for |
|---|---|
| `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` | KEK passphrase (required for the default `password` key provider) |
| `KEYORIX_CONFIG_PATH` | path to the config file |
| `KEYORIX_DB_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password |
| `KEYORIX_API_KEY` | API key for remote-client mode |
| `KEYORIX_SIEM_TOKEN` | SIEM push token (`audit.siem`) |
| `KEYORIX_SCIM_TOKEN` | SCIM provisioning bearer token (`scim`) |
| `KEYORIX_SSO_<NAME>_CLIENT_SECRET` | per-provider OIDC client secret (`sso`) |
| `KEYORIX_SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP relay password (`credential_delivery.smtp`) |
| `KEYORIX_DOMAIN` | substituted into `server` origins in the shipped example configs |
| _(operator-named)_ | the raw KEK, when `key_provider.type: env` (see [key_provider](#encryption--kek-providers)) |

## storage

```yaml
storage:

  database:
    # SQLite:
    path: /app/data/keyorix.db
    # PostgreSQL (recommended for production) — set type: postgres above:
    # dsn: "host=db user=keyorix dbname=keyorix port=5432 sslmode=require"
    # password: ""                # prefer KEYORIX_DB_PASSWORD
    max_open_conns: 25
    max_idle_conns: 5
    conn_max_lifetime_minutes: 30
```

`type: remote` points the CLI at a Keyorix server over the API; see the remote
section of the client config. Remote TLS verification is **on by default** —
an omitted `tls_verify` does not disable certificate checks.

## Encryption & KEK providers

Envelope encryption (ADR-004): a per-process **DEK** encrypts secrets/tokens and
is stored on disk wrapped by a **KEK**. `key_provider` selects where the KEK comes
from (ADR-038). When `encryption.enabled` is true and no `key_provider` is set,
the default `password` provider is used.

```yaml
storage:
  encryption:
    enabled: true
    dek_path: /app/keys/data.key  # wrapped DEK (never the raw key)
    salt_path: /app/keys/kek.salt # KEK salt (password provider only)

    # key_provider — default is "password" when omitted.
    key_provider:
      type: password              # password | file | env | exec | aws-kms | gcp-kms | azure-kms

      # type: file — read raw key material from a path (mounted CSI/sealed
      # secret, KMS sidecar output). Accepts 32 raw bytes, hex, or base64.
      # file_path: /etc/keyorix/kek.key

      # type: env — read the KEK (hex or base64) from the named env var's value.
      # env_var: KEYORIX_KEK

      # type: exec — run a resolver command and read the KEK (32 raw bytes, or
      # hex/base64) from its stdout. argv form (no shell); fetches from any
      # external secret store Keyorix has no built-in client for.
      # exec_command: ["op", "read", "op://vault/keyorix-kek/value"]

      # type: shamir — reconstruct the KEK from K-of-N Shamir shares (no single
      # custodian holds it). Provide at least the threshold many shares (hex/base64)
      # via files and/or env vars. Generate with `keyorix encryption shamir-split`.
      # shamir_share_files: [/etc/keyorix/share-1.hex, /etc/keyorix/share-2.hex, /etc/keyorix/share-3.hex]
      # shamir_share_env: [KX_KEK_SHARE_1, KX_KEK_SHARE_2]
      # shamir_commitment is also printed by shamir-split — set it so reconstruction
      # is verified by a real HMAC commitment, not just a forgeable framing check
      # (#429). Safe to store here in the clear: it's one-way, reveals nothing about
      # the KEK.
      # shamir_commitment: 3f9a…

      # type: tpm — seal the KEK to the host TPM 2.0. The KEK is generated and sealed
      # on first start; only the sealed blob (wrapped_key_path) is on disk, and it is
      # unsealable only on this machine's TPM.
      # tpm_device: /dev/tpmrm0
      # wrapped_key_path: keys/kek.tpm

      # type: aws-kms / gcp-kms / azure-kms — envelope-wrap the KEK with a cloud
      # KMS/HSM key (ADR-041); the wrapping key stays in the KMS/HSM. Credentials
      # come from the standard cloud environment (AWS: env/instance-profile/IRSA;
      # GCP: ADC; Azure: DefaultAzureCredential / managed identity).
      # kms_key_id: arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:123456789012:key/abcd-…                  # aws-kms
      # kms_key_id: projects/p/locations/eu/keyRings/r/cryptoKeys/keyorix-kek      # gcp-kms
      # kms_key_id: https://myvault.vault.azure.net/keys/keyorix-kek               # azure-kms
      # wrapped_key_path: keys/kek.kms
```

- **`password`** (default): KEK = PBKDF2-SHA256(`KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD`, salt,
  600 000). Requires `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD`. This is byte-identical to all
  prior releases — existing `dek.key` files keep working.
- **`file`** / **`env`**: the KEK is externally managed (e.g. injected by a KMS,
  CSI driver, or sealed/SOPS secret). `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` is **not** required.
- **`exec`**: the KEK is produced on stdout by an operator-configured resolver
  command (`exec_command`, an argv run **without a shell**) — e.g. `op read …`
  (1Password), `sops -d kek.enc`, `vault read -field=kek …`, or a CSI/sidecar
  helper. Output is 32 raw bytes or a hex/base64 encoding thereof. The command runs
  at startup (fail-closed, 30s timeout) and `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` is **not**
  required. The argv is trusted deployment config, like `file_path`/`env_var`.
- **`shamir`**: the KEK is split into **N Shamir shares** with a **K-of-N**
  threshold, so no single custodian holds it and at least K must combine to unseal
  (separation of duties for the master key). Generate with `keyorix encryption
  shamir-split --shares N --threshold K` (the KEK is never printed/stored — only the
  shares are, plus a `shamir_commitment` value). Provide at least K shares at
  startup via `shamir_share_files` and/or `shamir_share_env` (each a hex/base64
  share); the server reconstructs the KEK in memory. Also set `shamir_commitment` —
  without it, reconstruction falls back to a 4-byte magic check that (#429) an
  attacker holding threshold-1 genuine shares can forge to make ANY chosen value
  reconstruct; with it, the reconstructed KEK is verified against a real HMAC-SHA256
  commitment computed at split time. `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` is **not** required.
  Move an existing install onto it with `keyorix encryption migrate-provider
  --to-type shamir --to-shamir-share-files … --to-shamir-commitment …`. ⚠️ Losing
  more than N-K shares makes the KEK — and all data — permanently unrecoverable;
  store and back up shares separately.
- **`tpm`**: the KEK is **sealed to the host TPM 2.0** (`tpm_device`, default
  `/dev/tpmrm0`) and only unsealable on that machine. A random KEK is generated and
  sealed on first start; only the **sealed blob** (`wrapped_key_path`) touches disk,
  so the KEK can't be recovered from a stolen disk alone. `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD`
  is **not** required; startup needs the TPM reachable (fail-closed). ⚠️ The sealed
  blob is bound to *this* TPM — it cannot be unsealed on another host, so back up the
  data under a portable provider (or re-seal per host) and note that a TPM
  clear/replacement makes the blob unrecoverable. Move an existing install on with
  `keyorix encryption migrate-provider --to-type tpm --to-wrapped-key-path keys/kek.tpm`.
  ⚠️ **No PCR policy binding yet**: the seal is bound to "this TPM chip", not to a
  verified/measured boot state — no PolicyPCR session is used. Any code capable of
  asking the TPM to unseal the blob succeeds regardless of firmware/bootloader/kernel
  integrity, so this provider does **not** currently protect against a compromised
  boot chain on an otherwise-genuine, present TPM. This is a deliberate deferral, not
  an oversight: Keyorix ships as a plain binary/container with no owned host OS image
  or update hook, so it has no way to detect an impending firmware/bootloader/kernel
  patch and reseal beforehand, and there is no recovery/escrow fallback if a legitimate
  host update changes the PCR values — `migrate-provider` itself needs to unseal the
  *current* blob first, so it can't rescue a PCR-mismatched one. Adding PCR binding
  without also building that update-integration and recovery story would trade a
  narrow, known limitation for a silent risk of a routine host patch permanently
  destroying the KEK (and every secret under it); see `internal/crypto/tpm_provider.go`
  for the full reasoning.
- **`aws-kms`** / **`gcp-kms`** / **`azure-kms`** (ADR-041): the KEK is a random key
  **wrapped by a cloud KMS/HSM key**; only the wrapped blob is on disk
  (`wrapped_key_path`), unwrapped via the KMS at startup. The wrapping key never
  leaves the KMS/HSM. `kms_key_id` is an AWS key ID/ARN/alias, a GCP crypto-key
  resource name, or an Azure Key Vault key identifier URL.
  `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` is **not** required. Startup needs the KMS reachable
  (fail-closed).

> Rotating the **DEK** (`keyorix encryption rotate`) re-encrypts all rows under a
> new DEK and is independent of the provider.
>
> **Switching providers** (e.g. password → a cloud KMS) is
> `keyorix encryption migrate-provider --to-type <type> … --confirm` (ADR-041): it
> re-wraps the DEK under the target provider's KEK **without re-encrypting any
> data** (fast, no DB lock), verifies the target unwraps it, and keeps a backup of
> the previous wrapped DEK. Migrating `--to-type password` reads the new passphrase
> from `KEYORIX_NEW_MASTER_PASSWORD` and doubles as a master-passphrase rotation.
> After it succeeds, update `key_provider` in this config to the target before the
> next restart (the command prints the exact block).

If `encryption.enabled` is false, secrets and tokens are stored in **plaintext** —
acceptable only for local development.

## secrets

```yaml
secrets:
  chunking:
    enabled: true
    max_chunk_size_kb: 64
    max_chunks_per_secret: 100
  limits:
    max_secrets_per_user: 10000
```

## security

File-permission self-checks, plus the **deployment-wide MFA mandate** (ADR-034).

```yaml
security:
  enable_file_permission_check: true
  auto_fix_file_permissions: true
  allow_unsafe_file_permissions: false
  require_mfa: false              # true = mandate a second factor for interactive login
  login_lockout:
    enabled: false                # opt-in per-account lockout (brute-force protection)
    max_attempts: 5               # failed password logins within the window before locking
    window: "15m"                 # consecutive-failure window
    base_cooldown: "1m"           # lock duration for the first lockout
    max_cooldown: "1h"            # ceiling for the exponential backoff
```

With `require_mfa: true`, an interactive (session-authenticated) user **without** a
second factor is confined to the MFA-enrolment endpoints until they enrol. A TOTP
secret **or** a passkey satisfies it. Non-interactive credentials — personal
access tokens, machine tokens, OIDC — are **exempt** so automation is never broken.
Per-project MFA (ADR-037) is set per project via the API
(`PUT /projects/{id}` `{ "require_mfa": true }`), independent of this flag.

**Per-account login lockout** (`login_lockout`, opt-in) is brute-force protection
distinct from the per-IP rate limiter (ADR-040): after `max_attempts` failed
password logins within `window`, the account is locked for a cooldown that **backs
off exponentially** across repeated lockouts (`base_cooldown` × 2ⁿ, capped at
`max_cooldown`). While locked, even a correct password is refused. A successful login
clears the counter; an admin can clear a lock immediately with
`POST /api/v1/users/{id}/unlock` (`users.write`). It binds to the account (not the
IP), so rotating source IPs cannot evade it, and the lock auto-expires (no scheduler).

> **Tradeoff — account-lockout denial of service.** Because the lock binds to the
> account, anyone who knows a username can deliberately fail logins to keep that
> account locked. This is inherent to *any* account-bound lockout; here it is bounded
> by `max_cooldown` (the lock always self-heals) and an admin can clear it instantly.
> Keep `base_cooldown`/`max_cooldown` short enough that a lock-out attack degrades to a
> brief wait rather than a lasting denial — a large `max_cooldown` (e.g. hours) turns
> this defense into a weapon an attacker can wield against your users.

---

## webauthn

Phishing-resistant passkeys / FIDO2 as a second factor (ADR-036). Disabled by
default; when off, the passkey endpoints return 501 and login is unchanged.

```yaml
webauthn:
  enabled: true
  rp_id: keyorix.example.com           # effective domain, no scheme/port
  rp_display_name: Keyorix             # shown by the authenticator
  rp_origins:                          # full origins permitted to authenticate
    - https://keyorix.example.com
```

`rp_id` must be the registrable domain serving the app; `rp_origins` must include
the exact origin(s) the browser uses. A passkey satisfies `require_mfa`.

---

## dynamic_secrets

On-demand, short-lived database credentials (ADR-035). The API
(`/api/v1/dynamic-secrets/...`) is always served when the server runs; this block
only controls the **auto-revoke sweeper** that drops leases at expiry.

```yaml
dynamic_secrets:
  sweep_enabled: true            # revoke active leases past their TTL
  sweep_interval: "1m"           # cadence (Go duration); default 1m
```

Targets are registered via the API — or from the terminal with
`keyorix dynamic-secret create` (the admin DSN is read from the
`KEYORIX_DYNAMIC_ADMIN_DSN` env var or a hidden prompt, never a flag) — with an
admin DSN, a backend type (`postgres`, `mysql`, `mongodb`, `redis`, `aws-sts`, `gcp`,
or `azure`), an optional creation template, and a default TTL. The creation template
form depends on the backend:
- SQL backends (`postgres`, `mysql`) — an SQL grant template using `{{name}}`.
- `mongodb` — a JSON role spec (`{"roles": [{"role": "readWrite", "db": "app"}]}`);
  the admin DSN is a MongoDB connection URI.
- `redis` — whitespace-separated ACL rule tokens (`~app:* +@read +@write`); the
  admin DSN is a Redis URI (`redis://:pass@host:6379/0`, or `rediss://…` for TLS)
  for a user that holds the `+acl` command.
- `aws-sts` (cloud IAM) — the "admin DSN" is instead a small JSON config:
  `{"role_arn":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/keyorix-dyn","region":"eu-west-1","duration_seconds":3600}`
  (only `role_arn` is required). Issuing a lease calls `sts:AssumeRole` and returns
  short-lived **AWS credentials** (`access_key_id` / `secret_access_key` /
  `session_token`) rather than a username/password. The optional creation template is
  an inline **STS session policy** (JSON) that scopes the assumed role down. AWS
  credentials for the AssumeRole call itself come from the standard chain
  (env / instance-profile / IRSA), like the KMS and S3 integrations. STS credentials
  are **self-expiring and cannot be revoked or renewed** — a revoke is a no-op and a
  renew is refused (issue a new lease); minimum duration is 15 minutes (AWS limit).
- `gcp` (cloud IAM) — the JSON config is
  `{"service_account":"sa@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com","scopes":[...],"lifetime_seconds":3600}`
  (`service_account` required; `scopes` defaults to `cloud-platform`). Issuing mints a
  short-lived **service-account access token** (`access_token` field) via the IAM
  Credentials API; the caller's ADC identity (GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS /
  workload identity) must hold `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on the target SA.
- `azure` (cloud IAM) — the JSON config is
  `{"scopes":["https://management.azure.com/.default"]}`. Issuing acquires a short-lived
  **Azure AD (Entra) access token** (`access_token` field) via DefaultAzureCredential
  (env / managed identity / workload identity).

Like `aws-sts`, the `gcp` and `azure` backends mint **self-expiring tokens** — revoke
is a no-op, renew is refused, and they issue with the sweeper off (the cloud enforces
expiry); the optional creation template is unused by `gcp`/`azure`.

> **Enable the sweeper for MySQL, MongoDB and Redis targets.** Their accounts have
> no `VALID UNTIL` equivalent, so a lease TTL is enforced *only* by the sweeper —
> issuing is refused while it is disabled. PostgreSQL roles additionally carry a
> DB-level expiry (belt-and-suspenders). `aws-sts` is exempt: AWS enforces the
> credential's expiry, so it can issue with the sweeper off.

---

## oidc

Machine-identity federation: trust external OIDC issuers (e.g. Kubernetes
projected service-account tokens) and map verified JWTs to machine identities
(ADR-031). Disabled = OIDC auth off.

```yaml
oidc:
  enabled: true
  issuers:
    - name: prod-k8s
      issuer: https://kubernetes.default.svc          # must equal the JWT `iss`
      jwks_uri: https://kubernetes.default.svc/openid/v1/jwks   # https required
      audiences: ["keyorix"]                            # JWT `aud` must contain one
```

## session

Short-lived access tokens with silent refresh. Absent = a 24h access window and no
absolute ceiling (refreshable indefinitely — the legacy behaviour).

```yaml
session:
  access_ttl: "30m"     # access-token window before a refresh is needed (default 24h)
  absolute_ttl: "12h"   # hard cap on total session lifetime; "" or "0" = no ceiling
```

## password_policy

Password rules (ADR-025). Absent = conservative built-in defaults; when present,
the install's values fully replace them.

```yaml
password_policy:
  min_length: 12
  require_uppercase: true
  require_lowercase: true
  require_digit: true
  require_special: true
  reject_personal_info: true
  reject_common_passwords: true
  history_count: 5        # disallow reuse of the last N passwords
  max_age_days: 90        # 0 = no maximum age
```

---

## soft_delete & purge

Soft delete with a retention window, and an opt-in purge scheduler that hard-deletes
expired soft-deleted rows (ADR-032).

```yaml
soft_delete:
  enabled: true
  retention_days: 90      # grace period before a purge may remove (default 30)

purge:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "24h"         # Go duration between purge runs (default 24h)
```

## data_retention

An opt-in background scheduler that enforces **per-record-type retention windows**
on the compliance records Keyorix would otherwise accumulate indefinitely (ISO 27001
A.5.33 / GDPR storage-limitation / DORA record-keeping). Each `*_days` value is a
retention window in days; **`0` (the default) keeps that record type forever**. The
job hard-deletes records past their window, never touches active/open/pending rows,
and cascades to dependent rows (campaign items, request approvals).

It is **legal-hold-gated** — while a hold is active nothing is purged — and
single-replica-gated (ADR-039). Two things it deliberately never deletes: the
**audit trail** (append-only tamper-evidence, ADR-029) and **soft-deleted rows**
(those are the separate ADR-032 `purge` above).

```yaml
data_retention:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "24h"                              # Go duration between runs (default 24h)
  anomaly_alerts_days: 90                      # ACKNOWLEDGED access-anomaly alerts, on detected_at
  anomaly_alerts_unacked_ceiling_days: 730     # UNACKNOWLEDGED alerts — generous absolute-age safety net
  closed_access_reviews_days: 730              # closed recertification campaigns + items, on closed_at
  break_glass_days: 365                        # non-active emergency-access activations, on created_at
  resolved_access_requests_days: 365           # terminal-state access requests + approvals, on resolved_at
```

`anomaly_alerts_days` only ages out alerts a human has already **acknowledged** — a
never-acknowledged alert is still a live, unreviewed signal and is never purged by
that window alone, no matter how old (#415). `anomaly_alerts_unacked_ceiling_days`
is a separate, independent, and deliberately much longer window: a safety net so an
alert stream nobody ever acknowledges cannot accumulate rows forever (a
disk-exhaustion surface — the creation-time dedup window alone is trivially defeated
by varying the secret/type/actor/IP). Set it generously (a year or more) so it only
catches truly-ancient, almost-certainly-abandoned alerts, never a reasonable
operational review backlog.

The configured windows surface in the compliance posture (`keyorix compliance report`
→ "Data retention") as evidence that storage-limitation is actively enforced.

## recertification

An opt-in background scheduler that enforces an **access-recertification cadence**
(ISO 27001 A.5.18, "review access rights at planned intervals"). On each run it
walks every project and finds those **due for review** — never reviewed, or whose
most-recent review campaign closed more than `cadence_days` ago — that have no
campaign currently open. For each due project: when `auto_open` is true it opens a
fresh recertification campaign (system-actored, snapshotting current access);
otherwise it sends the project's admins an in-app reminder to open one. It also
nudges admins of an in-flight campaign that still has pending items. Reminders
de-dupe against an unread one, so they don't pile up. Single-replica-gated (ADR-039);
opening a campaign is a create, not a delete, so it runs even under a legal hold.

The cadence also drives the compliance posture's **projects-overdue** count (and
`keyorix compliance report` → Access governance → "overdue for recert"), so the
overdue signal is visible to auditors even before you enable `auto_open`.

```yaml
recertification:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "24h"        # Go duration between runs (default 24h)
  cadence_days: 90       # a project is due this many days after its last campaign closed (default 90)
  auto_open: false       # true = auto-open a campaign for overdue projects; false = remind admins only
```

## notifications

External delivery channels for the in-app notifications Keyorix already creates —
access-request approvals, anomaly alerts, rotation and recertification reminders, and
break-glass activations (ISO 27001 A.5.5 / SOC 2 operational alerting). Each
notification is still written to the in-app bell; when a channel is enabled it is
**also** fanned out, best-effort and asynchronously (a slow or down endpoint drops
rather than stalling the triggering action).

Two channels are available; enable either or both (both → each notification is
delivered to all). The **webhook** channel POSTs each notification as a JSON body
(`{user_id, email, type, title, message, project_id, link}`) to `endpoint`,
optionally bearer-authenticated. The **email** channel sends a plaintext message to
the recipient via the operator's SMTP relay (same settings as `credential_delivery`).

```yaml
notifications:
  webhook:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: "https://hooks.example.com/keyorix"
    token: ""                    # prefer the KEYORIX_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_TOKEN env var
    insecure_skip_verify: false  # TLS verification off — self-signed endpoints only
  email:
    enabled: true
    host: "smtp.example.com"
    port: 587
    username: "keyorix"
    password: ""                 # prefer the KEYORIX_NOTIFY_SMTP_PASSWORD env var
    from: "keyorix@example.com"
    tls: "starttls"              # starttls | implicit | none(dev-only) — none requires KEYORIX_ALLOW_INSECURE_SMTP=true
  slack:
    enabled: true
    webhook_url: ""              # prefer the KEYORIX_NOTIFY_SLACK_WEBHOOK env var
  teams:
    enabled: true
    webhook_url: ""              # prefer the KEYORIX_NOTIFY_TEAMS_WEBHOOK env var
```

The **slack** and **teams** channels POST to an incoming-webhook URL (Slack: a
`{text}` message; Teams: a MessageCard). The webhook URL embeds the platform's secret
token, so set it via the env var.

> Secrets are read from `KEYORIX_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` / `KEYORIX_NOTIFY_SMTP_PASSWORD`
> / `KEYORIX_NOTIFY_SLACK_WEBHOOK` / `KEYORIX_NOTIFY_TEAMS_WEBHOOK` when set, falling
> back to the YAML value — keep secrets out of the config file.

## compliance_digest

An opt-in scheduler that periodically **broadcasts a compliance summary** to the
configured notification channels (Slack/Teams/webhook) — a continuous-monitoring
digest of the control matrix + posture: controls pass/gap, projects overdue for
recertification, rotation gaps, unclassified secrets, open anomalies, and active risk
exceptions. It's a single broadcast per run (one message to the channel), and a no-op
when no [`notifications`](#notifications) channel is configured. Single-replica-gated
(ADR-039).

```yaml
compliance_digest:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "168h"   # Go duration between digests (default 24h; e.g. 168h = weekly)
```

## evidence_delivery

An opt-in background scheduler that periodically generates the **auditor evidence
pack** (the same bundle as `keyorix compliance export` / `GET /compliance/evidence`
— the posture plus the records that substantiate it) and writes it as a timestamped
JSON file to `output_dir`, for off-box archival/backup (ISO 27001 / SOC 2 continuous
evidence). Files are named `keyorix-evidence-<UTC-timestamp>.json` (mode `0600`; the
directory is created `0700` if absent).

Each export also emits a `compliance.evidence_exported` audit event, so an installed
[`audit.siem`](#auditsiem) forwarder receives the delivery signal too. Read-only, so
it runs even while a legal hold is active. Single-replica-gated (ADR-039).

Deliver to a local directory, an off-box **webhook** (POST of the pack JSON), an
**S3-compatible object store**, or any combination. At least one target must be
configured when enabled; when several are set the pack fans out to all of them.

```yaml
evidence_delivery:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "24h"                           # Go duration between exports (default 24h)
  output_dir: "/var/lib/keyorix/evidence"   # local archive; omit to deliver off-box only
  webhook:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: "https://evidence.example.com/keyorix"
    token: ""                               # prefer the KEYORIX_EVIDENCE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN env var
    insecure_skip_verify: false             # TLS verification off — self-signed endpoints only
  object_store:
    enabled: true
    bucket: "acme-compliance-evidence"      # required when enabled
    prefix: "keyorix/evidence/"             # optional key prefix
    region: "eu-west-1"
    endpoint: ""                            # optional — set for S3-compatible stores (MinIO/R2/…)
    use_path_style: false                   # set true for MinIO and some gateways
    lock_mode: ""                           # "" | governance | compliance (S3 Object Lock / WORM)
    lock_retain_days: 0                     # retention window; required (>0) when lock_mode is set
    legal_hold: false                       # place an indefinite S3 Object Lock legal hold on each object
```

> The off-box targets let evidence survive the node without a mounted volume. A file
> write is the primary durable target (its failure is fatal); an off-box delivery
> failure is recorded in the audit note but does not fail the export when a file was
> also written. The webhook token is read from `KEYORIX_EVIDENCE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` when
> set.
>
> **Object store.** Works with AWS S3 and S3-compatible stores (MinIO, Cloudflare R2,
> Backblaze B2, GCS interop) — point `endpoint` at the store and set `use_path_style:

> Object Lock enabled.

When **encryption is enabled**, each exported pack is **signed**: a detached
`<file>.json.sig` is written next to it (and the webhook delivery carries the
signature in the `X-Keyorix-Evidence-Signature` header). The signature is an HMAC
keyed by a DEK-derived key the database/DBA does not hold, so an archived pack's
authenticity is provable later — verify with `keyorix compliance verify --file
<pack>` (it asks the server, which recomputes the HMAC; a signature made under a
pre-rotation DEK is reported as unverifiable rather than tampered).

## rotation_reminders

An opt-in background scheduler that notifies project admins (in-app) of secrets
**overdue or approaching** their rotation deadline under an active rotation policy —
proactive rotation hygiene (a NIS2/ISO control). One standing reminder per project
per admin; once read, a still-overdue secret nudges again on the next run.
Single-replica-gated (ADR-039) so admins aren't notified N times in HA.

```yaml
rotation_reminders:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "24h"         # Go duration between reminder runs (default 24h)
```

## certificate_expiry

An opt-in background scan (ADR-055) that parses **certificate-typed** secrets and
notifies project admins (in-app) of certificates that are **expired or expiring**
within `lead_days`, using the certificate's *real* `notAfter` (not the manually-set
`expiration` field, which cert secrets usually leave unset). One standing reminder per
project per admin, de-duplicated like the rotation reminder; single-replica-gated
(ADR-039). The scan reads certificate values to extract the expiry only — it never
exposes the value or any private key, and skips suspended secrets. Opt-in (default off).

```yaml
certificate_expiry:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "24h"         # Go duration between scans (default 24h)
  lead_days: 30           # warn this many days before notAfter (default 30)
```

## audit_checkpoints

An opt-in background scheduler that signs the audit hash-chain head (ADR-029) so
**tail-truncation and genesis re-seed are detectable on-box**, not just via an
off-box anchor. Each run records a `(chained_events, head_id, head_hash)`
checkpoint with an HMAC keyed by a DEK-derived key the database/DBA does not hold;
`keyorix audit verify` (and `GET /audit/verify`) then enforce the live chain
against the latest checkpoint. Single-replica-gated (ADR-039).

**Requires encryption enabled** — the signing key is derived from the DEK, so with
encryption off the scheduler logs a warning and does nothing.

```yaml
audit_checkpoints:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "12h"         # Go duration between checkpoint writes (default 24h)
```

**External-notary anchoring** (`audit.checkpoint_notary`, opt-in). The checkpoint
HMAC is keyed by a DEK-derived key the running server holds — which detects
truncation/rewrite by a *database* actor, but an attacker who also obtains the DEK
could forge a checkpoint. Anchoring each written checkpoint to an external **RFC
3161 timestamp authority (TSA)** adds an independent, signed proof-of-existence over
the checkpoint's canonical bytes that binds it to a third party's clock and signing
key — which that attacker does not control, and cannot backdate. The TSA token is
stored on the checkpoint and re-verifiable offline. Anchoring is **best-effort**: a
TSA failure leaves the checkpoint un-anchored (still a valid checkpoint) and the
next write retries — it never blocks checkpointing.

```yaml
audit:
  checkpoint_notary:
    enabled: true
    type: rfc3161                  # the only type today (default)
    url: https://freetsa.org/tsr   # TSA timestamp-query endpoint
    timeout: "15s"                 # Go duration for the TSA round-trip (default 15s)
    ca_cert_path: /etc/keyorix/tsa-ca.pem  # PEM of the TSA's trusted root/CA cert(s)
```

> `ca_cert_path` is the **trust anchor** used to *verify* a stored anchor's issuer.
> Verification chains the token's signer to one of these roots (with the
> time-stamping EKU), so a self-signed/untrusted token — which the very actor the
> anchor defends against (a DEK + database-write attacker) could otherwise mint — is
> rejected. Without `ca_cert_path`, anchoring still records tokens but verification
> **fails closed** (it will not assert an unverifiable proof). Supply the TSA's CA
> bundle (e.g. FreeTSA's `cacert.pem`).
>
> The new checkpoint's anchor (asserted time + TSA) is shown by
> `keyorix audit checkpoint`. Requires `audit_checkpoints` to be doing the writing
> (which requires encryption — the checkpoint signing key is DEK-derived).

## jit_access_expiry

An opt-in background sweeper for **just-in-time / time-bound access**. A role grant
can carry an expiry — set it by approving an access request with a TTL (`keyorix
request review --action approve --ttl 4h …`, or `grant_ttl` on the resolve API).
An expired grant **stops authorizing immediately** (the authorization queries
filter on expiry, so access is denied the moment the TTL passes — independent of
this sweep); the sweeper then reclaims the rows and writes a `role.expired` audit
event for each. Single-replica-gated (ADR-039).

Leaving this disabled does not weaken enforcement — expired grants are still
denied at authorization time — it only means the expired rows linger until a
sweeper (anywhere) runs.

```yaml
jit_access_expiry:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "1h"          # Go duration between expiry sweeps (default 1h)
```

## break_glass

Opt-in **self-service emergency access** (incident response — NIS2/DORA). When
enabled, any authenticated user can `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/break-glass` (or run
`keyorix break-glass activate`) to **immediately** self-grant the configured
emergency role at that project — no approval. The activation is **time-bound** (it
auto-expires via the JIT mechanism, so it stops authorizing on its own), requires a
**written justification**, is **loudly audited** (`break_glass.activated`), and
**alerts the project's admins**. Each activation is a queryable record for post-hoc
review (`GET …/break-glass`, `keyorix break-glass list`).

Deliberately not RBAC-gated — the point is access the caller does *not* have — so
the controls are: it must be enabled here, every use is justified + audited +
alerted, the grant expires, and an admin can revoke it early.

```yaml
break_glass:
  enabled: true
  emergency_role: "project_developer" # role granted on activation — must be
                                       # contained (no roles.assign); "project_admin"
                                       # is REJECTED at activation time
  default_ttl: "4h"                 # grant lifetime when none is requested
  max_ttl: "24h"                    # ceiling on a requested TTL
```

## dual_control

**N-of-M approval (dual control)** for access-request grants (ISO 27001 A.5.3 /
SOX): instead of one admin's approval granting the role immediately, a request
requires `required_approvals` **distinct** approvers — and never the requester
(maker ≠ checker) — before the role is granted. Each sign-off is audited; the
request listing shows the M-of-K progress and remaining approvers are notified. A
value of `1` (the default) keeps the single-approval behaviour.

```yaml
dual_control:
  required_approvals: 2   # distinct approvers needed per access request (default 1)
```

## classification

Whether the **"restricted" data-classification label** (the highest tier;
`public`/`internal`/`confidential`/`restricted`, see `internal/core/classification.go`)
changes read-time behaviour. **Disabled by default** — today, "restricted" is
purely informational metadata; setting `restricted_requires_approval: true` for
the first time is a **breaking behaviour change** for any deployment that already
has "restricted" secrets, since they were previously readable like any other with
sufficient RBAC. Opt in deliberately, only once you also have a plan for
approving requests (below) — otherwise every "restricted" secret's value becomes
permanently unreadable the moment you enable this.

When enabled, reading a "restricted" secret's **value** (not its metadata —
`GetSecret`/listing are unaffected) requires an approved, **secret-scoped**
access request: `keyorix request secret-access --secret-id <id> --user
<email>` to request it, `keyorix request review --id <id> --action approve
--by <admin-email>` to approve it (an administrator at the secret's project).
This reuses the same `AccessRequest` model/flow as `dual_control` above
(ADR-024), narrowed with a `SecretID` rather than granting a role. A read whose
acting principal cannot be identified as a specific user — a machine/service
identity, for instance — is **always denied** when this is on: there is no
"wait for approval" for automation, and no bypass for it either.

```yaml
classification:
  restricted_requires_approval: false   # opt-in; see above before enabling
```

## anomaly_alerts

**Proactive alerting** for detected access anomalies (NIS2 detection & response).
Anomaly detection (off-hours / new-IP / new-user access to secrets) always runs on
the scan schedule; when this is enabled, each **newly detected** anomaly is also
pushed out — an in-app alert to the project's admins **and** a
`security.anomaly_detected` audit event (which the SIEM forwarder picks up, so
anomalies reach your SOC). Each anomaly is announced once. Single-replica-gated
(ADR-039). Opt-in (default off — detection still runs and alerts are visible via
`keyorix anomalies list` / the API, just not pushed).

```yaml
anomaly_alerts:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "1h"          # Go duration between scan+alert passes (default 1h)
```

### anomaly_alerts.ml — Isolation Forest detection (ADR-050)

An optional **machine-learning** detection pass that complements the statistical rules
above. Each scan trains a per-secret [Isolation Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_forest)
on the secret's 30-day access baseline and flags accesses whose joint pattern (hour,
IP rarity, user rarity) is a multivariate outlier — catching two things the binary
rules miss: a **known-but-rare** actor or IP (the new-user/new-IP rules only see
"known"), and **combinations** that are unremarkable signal-by-signal. Flagged accesses
emit an `ml_outlier` anomaly alert that flows through the same list / acknowledge /
alert / retention paths as every other alert. Metadata only — no secret value is ever
examined.

`ml.enabled` is **independent** of `anomaly_alerts.enabled`: it gates whether the scan
additionally runs the ML pass; `anomaly_alerts.enabled` gates whether detected
anomalies are pushed out. Opt-in (default off).

```yaml
anomaly_alerts:
  enabled: true
  ml:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.60       # anomaly-score cutoff in (0.5,1.0); higher = fewer alerts (default 0.60)
    num_trees: 100        # forest size (default 100)
    sample_size: 256      # per-tree subsample ψ (default 256)
    seed: 1               # RNG seed; fixed so scoring is reproducible (default 1)
```

## audit.siem

Native push of audit events to a SIEM. The token is read from `KEYORIX_SIEM_TOKEN`
when set, so it need not be written to the file.

```yaml
audit:
  siem:
    enabled: true
    provider: splunk            # splunk | datadog | webhook
    endpoint: https://siem.example.com/services/collector
    # token: ""                 # prefer KEYORIX_SIEM_TOKEN
    insecure_skip_verify: false # never true in production
```

## scim

SCIM 2.0 provisioning (RFC 7644). When enabled, Keyorix serves `/scim/v2` so an
identity provider (Okta, Entra ID, …) can **provision, update, deactivate, and
deprovision users** automatically. The endpoints are authenticated by a single
**static bearer token** the IdP presents — separate from the session/PAT auth — and
emit SCIM-format JSON, not the API envelope.

A SCIM `userName` (typically an email/UPN) maps to the user's email; a compliant
alphanumeric Keyorix username is **derived** from it, and the IdP's `externalId` is
stored for reconciliation. Provisioned users have no usable password (they sign in
via SSO or set one out-of-band) and start in `pending_first_login`; SCIM
`active:false` (or DELETE) suspends the account and terminates its sessions.

Both the **Users** and **Groups** resources are supported (plus
`ServiceProviderConfig`): groups map to native Keyorix groups (displayName → name),
with PUT replacing the full member set and PATCH adding/removing members.

```yaml
scim:
  enabled: true
  token: ""        # prefer the KEYORIX_SCIM_TOKEN env var — the IdP's bearer token
```

> Set `token` only via `KEYORIX_SCIM_TOKEN`. Point your IdP's SCIM connector at
> `https://<host>/scim/v2` with that token as the bearer credential.

## sso

Human single-sign-on login via **OIDC** (authorization-code flow). When enabled, the
login page offers a "Sign in with <provider>" button: the user authenticates at their
IdP and Keyorix mints the same session a password login would — so an IdP-provisioned
([`scim`](#scim)) user, who has no password, can actually sign in. SSO logins bypass
Keyorix-local MFA (the IdP is the authenticator).

Each provider's endpoints are **discovered** from its issuer
(`/.well-known/openid-configuration`), so only the issuer + client credentials +
redirect URL are needed. On callback Keyorix verifies the id_token (signature against
the issuer's JWKS, issuer, audience = `client_id`, expiry, and the nonce it issued)
and maps the identity to a Keyorix user — by the IdP subject (matched against the SCIM
`externalId`) first, then by email. By default there is **no auto-provisioning**: the
account must already exist (provision it via SCIM or invite). A suspended user is
refused.

```yaml
sso:
  enabled: true
  providers:
    - name: okta                 # also the URL slug: /auth/sso/okta/login
      issuer: https://your-tenant.okta.com
      client_id: 0oa...
      client_secret: ""          # prefer the KEYORIX_SSO_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET env var
      redirect_url: https://keyorix.example.com/auth/sso/okta/callback
      scopes: [openid, profile, email]
      auto_provision: false      # JIT-create an account on first login (default off)
      default_role: system_viewer # baseline role for JIT-provisioned users
      group_sync: false          # reconcile native group memberships from the IdP (default off)
      groups_claim: groups       # id_token claim carrying group names (default "groups")
      group_role_map:            # map IdP groups → Keyorix system roles (optional)
        keyorix-admins: system_admin
        keyorix-auditors: system_auditor
```

> The client secret is read from `KEYORIX_SSO_<NAME>_CLIENT_SECRET` (name upper-cased,
> e.g. `KEYORIX_SSO_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET`). Register the `redirect_url` exactly as above
> at the IdP. A provider whose discovery fails at startup is skipped with a warning,
> not fatal.

**Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning.** Set `auto_provision: true` on a provider to
JIT-create a Keyorix account the first time an identity that matches no existing user
signs in — useful when an IdP isn't wired for SCIM push. The account is created
**active** and passwordless (the IdP is the authenticator), with the IdP subject
stored as its `externalId` for future reconciliation, and is granted `default_role`
(`system_viewer` when unset; an unknown role grants nothing — least-privilege on
misconfiguration). The JIT creation is audited as `auth.sso_jit_provisioned`. The IdP
must return an `email` claim (request the `email` scope), or the login is refused. A
later SCIM push for the same `externalId` reconciles to the same account. Leave
`auto_provision` off to require that accounts be provisioned ahead of time.

> **Email trust.** An email an IdP explicitly marks unverified (`email_verified:
> false`) is not used to match an existing account or to provision a new one — only
> the subject (`externalId`) match applies for that login. An absent `email_verified`
> claim is treated as trusted (it is optional in OIDC; some enterprise IdPs such as
> Entra ID omit it for a configured, trusted issuer).

**Group sync (JIT group membership).** Set `group_sync: true` to reconcile a user's
**native Keyorix group memberships** from the IdP's group claim on each login — so the
IdP drives group-based access without a separate SCIM push. The named claim
(`groups_claim`, default `groups`; some IdPs use `roles`) is read from the verified
id_token and the IdP is treated as **authoritative**: the user is added to native
groups whose name matches an asserted group and **removed from native groups it did
not assert**, so revoking a group at the IdP deprovisions the matching Keyorix access
on next login. Only groups that **already exist natively** (provisioned via
[`scim`](#scim) Groups or by an admin) are touched — an asserted group with no native
counterpart is ignored, and groups are never created or deleted. The net change is
audited as `auth.sso_groups_synced`.

> Because it is authoritative, **do not mix `group_sync` with manual group assignment**
> for SSO users — a manually-added membership not asserted by the IdP is removed on the
> next login. If the `groups_claim` is **absent** from the id_token (e.g. the IdP only
> emits groups at the userinfo endpoint, or behind a scope you didn't request), the
> sync is a safe no-op — it never strips memberships on a missing claim. Ensure the IdP
> is configured to emit the group claim in the id_token (in Okta, add a groups claim to
> the ID token; in Entra, configure the optional `groups` claim).

**Group → role mapping.** `group_role_map` maps an IdP group (from the same
`groups_claim`) to a Keyorix **system role**, so the IdP can drive role assignment
directly — e.g. members of `keyorix-admins` become `system_admin` on login. It is
**authoritative only over the mapped roles**: on each login the user is granted the
roles their asserted groups map to and **loses any mapped role they no longer
qualify for**, while roles *not* named in the map are never touched (so manually
granted roles are safe). Like `group_sync`, an absent groups claim is a no-op (it
won't strip roles), an unknown role name is skipped, and roles are bound at global
scope. This works independently of `group_sync` (you can map roles without syncing
group memberships, or both). Changes are audited as `auth.sso_roles_synced`.

> Because it is authoritative over the mapped roles, prefer managing those roles
> **only** through the IdP — a mapped role granted manually to an SSO user is removed
> on their next login if the IdP doesn't assert the corresponding group.
>
> ⚠️ **Security — the mapped IdP groups become privilege grants.** Membership of any
> group named in `group_role_map` directly drives Keyorix authorization on every
> login, and a group mapped to `system_admin` confers **global administrator** access.
> Only map groups whose membership is **governed by your IdP administrators** (e.g. an
> Okta/Entra group whose roster only IdP admins can change) — never a self-service,
> open-enrolment, or user-requestable group, or anyone who can join that group at the
> IdP gains the mapped Keyorix role. Treat the mapping like handing out the role
> itself: scope it to the least-privileged role that fits, and reserve admin mappings
> for tightly controlled groups. Keyorix trusts the IdP's `groups` claim (verified
> id_token) as the source of truth, so the IdP's group governance *is* your Keyorix
> RBAC governance for these roles.

## membership

Project-membership onboarding mode (ADR-022).

```yaml
membership:
  validation_mode: allowlist    # open | allowlist (default) | idp
```

## credential_delivery

How a brand-new principal receives their first-credential setup link (ADR-028).

```yaml
credential_delivery:
  mode: smtp                    # auto | smtp | out_of_band | log
  setup_token_ttl: "24h"        # single-use link lifetime (default 24h)
  base_url: https://keyorix.example.com   # required for any link-producing mode
  smtp:
    host: smtp.example.com
    port: 587
    username: keyorix@example.com

    from: keyorix@example.com
    tls: starttls               # starttls | implicit | none (dev only)
```

`out_of_band` / `log` return or log the link instead of emailing it (useful when no
mail relay is available). A link-producing mode with an empty `base_url` is a
misconfiguration — link minting refuses it rather than emitting a relative link.

`mode: log` writes a live, usable setup link to the application log (dev/test only) and
`smtp.tls: none` sends mail — and any relay credentials — in cleartext. Both are refused
at startup unless the operator explicitly opts in by setting
`KEYORIX_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOG_DELIVERY=true` (for `mode: log`) or
`KEYORIX_ALLOW_INSECURE_SMTP=true` (for `smtp.tls: none`), mirroring how other insecure
toggles in this codebase require an explicit acknowledgement rather than defaulting on.
The same `KEYORIX_ALLOW_INSECURE_SMTP` gate also applies to `notify.smtp.tls: none` for
the notification-email channel.

## connect

**Keyorix Connect** (ADR-043) is opt-in **read-through federation** to external
secret stores: it proxies an authorized, audited read of a secret's *current* value
held in an external store, without importing or persisting it. Disabled by default;
with no connectors the `/connect` endpoints are not served.

```yaml
connect:
  enabled: true
  connectors:
    - name: prod-aws            # API path key (unique); GET /api/v1/connect/prod-aws/secret?ref=…
      type: aws-secrets-manager # aws-secrets-manager | gcp-secret-manager | azure-key-vault | vault
      region: eu-west-1         # AWS region (aws-secrets-manager)
      allowed_refs:             # optional prefix allowlist — a ref must match one
        - keyorix/              # (defense-in-depth on top of the backend's IAM scope)
    - name: prod-gcp
      type: gcp-secret-manager  # ref is the version resource name (creds from ADC)
      project_id: my-proj       # recommended: pins the connector to one GCP project (#431);
                                 # a ref naming a different project is rejected before the backend call
      allowed_refs:
        - projects/my-proj/secrets/keyorix-
    - name: prod-azure
      type: azure-key-vault     # ref is the secret name (or name/version); creds from DefaultAzureCredential
      address: https://myvault.vault.azure.net/   # the Key Vault URL
      allowed_refs:
        - keyorix-
    - name: prod-vault
      type: vault               # ref is the read path; KV v2 is unwrapped
      address: https://vault.example.com:8200
      token_env: VAULT_TOKEN    # env var holding the Vault token (default VAULT_TOKEN)
      allowed_refs:
        - secret/data/keyorix/
```

- Reads are **read-only** and gated by the dedicated `connect.read` permission
  (ADR-044) — distinct from `secrets.read`, so external-store access is granted
  explicitly (it ships granted to `admin` / `system_admin`); each is audited as
  `connect.secret_read`. The value is returned to the caller and never stored.
- `ref` (query parameter) is connector-specific — for **AWS Secrets Manager** it is
  the secret **name or ARN** (a binary secret is returned base64-encoded); for **GCP
  Secret Manager** it is the **version resource name**
  (`projects/P/secrets/NAME/versions/latest`); for **Azure Key Vault** it is the
  **secret name** (optionally `name/version`; a bare name reads the current version)
  within the connector's `address` vault; for **Vault** it is the **read path**
  (e.g. `secret/data/myapp` for KV v2, whose inner `data` map is returned). GCP
  credentials come from ADC / workload identity; Azure from `DefaultAzureCredential`
  (managed/workload identity / env / CLI); the Vault token comes from `token_env`.
- Backend credentials come from the **ambient identity chain** (AWS: env /
  instance-profile / IRSA; GCP: ADC; Azure: `DefaultAzureCredential`; Vault:
  `token_env`), never from this config. A backend failure surfaces as `502 Bad Gateway`.
- Unlike Vault (pinned to one `address`) and Azure Key Vault (pinned to one `address`
  vault URL), a GCP Secret Manager ref carries **its own project ID**, so a
  `gcp-secret-manager` connector with no **`project_id`** can address secrets in
  **any** GCP project the ambient ADC identity can reach — `allowed_refs` is then the
  only guardrail. Setting `project_id` (#431) pins the connector to one project: any
  ref naming a different project is rejected before the backend call. It is optional
  (existing configs keep today's cross-project behavior for compatibility) but
  strongly recommended; an unset `project_id` logs a startup warning.
- A federated read is bounded by up to **three** controls: the backend identity's IAM
  policy (the load-bearing one — scope the connector's credentials to exactly the
  intended secrets); optionally the per-connector **`allowed_refs`** prefix allowlist
  enforced in Keyorix before the backend call; and optionally **per-reference RBAC
  grants** (ADR-045) — a `(role, connector, ref_prefix)` allowlist. Set the IAM policy
  for sure: any holder of `connect.read` can otherwise read every secret the
  connector's identity can reach.
- **Per-reference RBAC (ADR-045)** scopes *which roles* may read *which refs* on a
  connector. It is opt-in per connector: a connector with **no** grants behaves as
  before (governed by `connect.read` + `allowed_refs`), but once a connector has any
  grant it is **deny-by-default** — only a caller holding a role with a matching
  ref-prefix grant may read, and a denied read is audited. A grant pattern is a
  **prefix** by default; one containing glob metacharacters (`*`, `?`, `[`) matches as
  a shell-style glob (`*` does not cross `/`), e.g. `prod/*/db`. Manage grants at
  `GET /api/v1/connect/ref-grants` (`roles.read`), `POST /api/v1/connect/ref-grants`
  and `DELETE /api/v1/connect/ref-grants/{id}` (`roles.write`). To keep an admin role's
  blanket access while scoping others, give it an **empty-prefix** grant (matches every
  ref) on the connector.

# Keyorix Threat Model

> **Positioning.** This is an engineering threat model, not a certification or an
> audit report. It states what Keyorix defends against, how, and what is
> deliberately out of scope or still open — with a code, test, or ADR citation for
> every claim. See [`../compliance/README.md`](../compliance/README.md) for the
> regulatory-framework mappings this threat model underpins.

## 1. Scope and method

Keyorix is a self-hosted secrets manager: an operator runs the server (and,
optionally, the CLI, gRPC clients, the web UI, and Kubernetes delivery agents)
entirely inside their own infrastructure. There is no Keyorix-operated cloud in
the secret-resolution path. This document covers the product as shipped on
`main` as of 2026-09-25, and is organized the way
[`../security-review-2026-09.md`](../security-review-2026-09.md) — the primary
evidence source behind §4 — was itself organized: by trust boundary, then by
STRIDE category, with an explicit mitigation and an explicit residual risk for
every entry. Nothing below is invented for this document; every mitigation cites
the code, ADR, or test that implements or proves it.

**What this document does not do:** it does not re-derive findings that
`security-review-2026-09.md` already investigated and closed — it cites that
review's conclusions and adds the trust-boundary structure the review itself
didn't organize around. It also does not treat `docs/findings/*.md` (a live,
in-progress internal audit campaign, most recently touched 2026-09-25) as
settled evidence — those are cited only where explicitly marked "in progress,"
never as closed.

## 2. Assets

| Asset | Where it lives | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Secret values** (plaintext) | Transient: process heap, between decryption and response/wipe | The product's core promise: only an authorized, authenticated caller ever sees one. |
| **Secret ciphertext** | `secret_nodes` and related tables, AES-256-GCM under the current DEK | Confidentiality rests on the DEK never leaking and AAD binding preventing ciphertext substitution. |
| **DEK (Data Encryption Key)** | Wrapped by the KEK, stored alongside the encrypted data | Compromise = compromise of every secret value in the install. |
| **KEK (Key Encryption Key)** | File, KMS/HSM, or TPM-backed (`internal/config/config.go` `KeyProvider`) | Compromise of the KEK, plus the wrapped DEK, is total compromise. Where the KEK IS the threat boundary is exactly where "host root" stops mattering — see §5.1. |
| **Audit chain hash-chain key material** (checkpoint HMAC key) | HKDF-derived from the KEK, held only in server process memory (ADR-029, `#502` correction) | Lets a DB-only actor tamper with history undetectably; never persisted to the database itself. |
| **Recovery key** | SHA-256 verifier only, `internal/recoverykey`, `internal/storage/store/local_recovery_key.go` | The one credential that can restore admin access when every admin account is locked out — see §5.1. |
| **Session / PAT / machine / setup / reset tokens** | SHA-256-hashed at rest (session tokens are 256-bit random opaque values looked up directly — `SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md` "Known, accepted residual risks") | Each is a distinct blast radius: session (time-bounded), PAT (until revoked, now scopeable per ADR-042), machine identity (service-to-service), setup/reset (single-use, short-TTL). |
| **Audit log content** | `audit_events`, hash-chained (ADR-029) | The record a regulator or an incident responder relies on; must be complete, attributable, and itself tamper-evident. |
| **TLS/OIDC signing material** | Operator-supplied certs; issuer JWKS fetched over HTTPS only | Protects the transport and the machine-identity federation trust boundary. |

## 3. Trust boundaries

| # | Boundary | What crosses it | Enforcement chokepoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | **CLI → server (remote mode)** | HTTP requests carrying a session/PAT/machine token | Same HTTP middleware + `core.Authorize` as any browser/API client |
| B2 | **CLI → local SQLite (local mode)** | Direct storage-layer calls, no network hop | **None equivalent to B1** — see §5.2, this is today's largest open item |
| B3 | **REST API** | Every human- and machine-facing HTTP request | `core.Authorize(user, permission, scope)` at every handler |
| B4 | **gRPC API** | A partial (86-RPC), data-plane-only subset of the REST surface | The *same* `core.Authorize` call, reached from `server/grpc/services/*` (ADR-105) |
| B5 | **Web UI ↔ server** | Session cookie (`kx_session`, HttpOnly+Secure+SameSite=Lax) + CSRF double-submit token | `server/middleware/session_cookie.go`; verified in `security-review-2026-09.md`'s frontend token-storage check |
| B6 | **k8s-sync / operator / ESO ↔ server** | Machine-identity token, by-reference secret reads (`GET /api/v1/secrets/value?ref=…`, ADR-059) | Same `core.Authorize` chokepoint; least-privilege namespace-scoped RBAC on the Kubernetes side (ADR-076) |
| B7 | **Server ↔ external connectors/KMS/rotation targets** (AWS/Azure/GCP SDKs, Vault, Postgres/MySQL rotation targets) | Outbound calls carrying operator-configured credentials | Per-connector `allowed_refs` allowlist + project/environment scoping (ADR-082); SSRF/link-local guards (`internal/netutil`, `internal/core/dynamic_secrets_ssrf_test.go`) |
| B8 | **Admin host access** (`keyorix-server admin …`) | Direct DB + key-file access, no network hop, by design | Host access IS the authority (ADR-108 decision B) — see §5.1 |
| B9 | **Backups** | A `pg_dump` of the database plus a copy of the key-material volume | Neither half alone is useful — see §5.3 |
| B10 | **Supply chain** (CI, dependencies, release artifacts) | Third-party code entering the build; the build entering a customer's environment | CI gates enumerated in `SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md` — see §5.4 |

## 4. STRIDE per trust boundary

Each row: **Threat → Mitigation → Evidence → Residual risk.**

### B3/B4 — REST and gRPC API (the primary attack surface)

- **Spoofing** (forged identity) → Tokens minted from `crypto/rand` (256-bit),
  reusable tokens SHA-256-hashed and looked up by hash, never compared in
  plaintext → `SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md` "Token handling" → Residual: a leaked
  raw token is valid until revoked/expired; mitigated by short session TTLs and
  an absolute lifetime ceiling refresh cannot extend.
- **Tampering** (unauthorized data modification) → Every write path funnels
  through `core.Authorize`/`core.AuthorizePrincipal` before mutation; PAT
  restrictions apply *before* role resolution and the admin bypass (ADR-042) →
  `internal/core/authz.go` → Residual: none identified beyond ordinary
  authenticated-actor-does-authorized-thing (see B2 for the one bypass path
  that exists today).
- **Repudiation** (denying an action happened) → Every security-relevant
  action is audited with actor identity, `actor_type`, and outcome, including
  impersonation attribution → `AUDIT-LOG-PROVISIONS.md` → Residual: an action
  that predates the reader's retention window is only as durable as the
  operator's own PostgreSQL retention (Keyorix imposes no cap — this is a
  documented operator responsibility, not a gap).
- **Information disclosure** → No plaintext secret values, key bytes,
  passphrases, or raw tokens in logs (regression-tested); scoped RBAC limits
  read access → `SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md` §"No plaintext in logs" →
  **Residual, open and in progress**: an active internal audit
  (`docs/findings/2026-09-25-FINDING-api-raw-model-exposure.md`) found ~26
  REST routes serializing raw, untagged Go structs, including two routes
  (`SearchAuditLogs`, `AccessHistory`) that leak `IPAddress` (PII) where a
  sibling route already redacts it. This is a real, currently-open gap, not a
  hypothetical — it is not yet closed as of this document's writing, and this
  threat model does not claim it is.
- **Denial of service** → Rate limiting, payload/timeout bounds, pagination,
  bulk-op batch caps, and a bounded-BFS fix for `transitiveDependents`
  (matching its sibling `blastBFS`'s node/depth cap) → `security-review-2026-09.md`
  "Availability and denial-of-service resistance" → Residual: none identified
  in the review beyond ordinary capacity planning.
- **Elevation of privilege** → Scoped RBAC (system/project/environment),
  least-privilege defaults (`system_viewer`), cross-project isolation
  enforced at every nested-resource route, gRPC authorized identically to
  HTTP (no flat-vs-scoped gap) → `SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md` "Access control &
  authorisation" hardening log → Residual: none identified after the
  cross-transport parity fix; the admin-bypass marker itself is now a
  structural, non-freeform field (ADR-084) rather than a name-matched role,
  closing the prior self-escalation-via-role-rename risk class.

### B1/B2 — CLI (remote vs. local mode)

- **Elevation of privilege via local mode** → **Not mitigated today.** CLI
  local mode opens the SQLite database directly — it is, structurally, a
  second server that bypasses the API's authorization, audit, and rate
  limiting entirely (ADR-108 Context: "it works in two modes: local... which
  makes it a second server that bypasses the API's authorization, audit and
  rate limits"). This is the single largest structural item in this threat
  model. **Planned fix, not yet shipped**: ADR-108 (Accepted 2026-09-23)
  removes local mode entirely, making the CLI a thin network client with no
  local database access. As of this writing, only early steps of that program
  are measured (ADR-109's M4 table shows steps 0–2 of 7). Anyone relying on
  this threat model to evaluate current risk should treat CLI local-mode
  access as equivalent to direct database access — because it is.
- **CLI remote mode** → Same authorization/audit/rate-limit coverage as any
  other HTTP client (B3) → Residual: the `/system` storage-proxy tier
  (`RemoteStorage`) that remote mode uses today has needed its own
  re-implementation of each human-facing route's authorization, which is
  exactly the class of bug the 2026-09 review's raw-storage-bypass sweep found
  and closed (16 issues, `TestNoUnjustifiedRawStorageBypass` now covers the
  full 500+ route surface) — closed as a *class*, via a guard, not a fixed
  list, but the proxy tier itself is slated for deletion once ADR-108 lands
  (fewer moving parts, not just fixed ones).

### B5 — Web UI

- **Spoofing / session theft (XSS)** → Session token delivered exclusively via
  an `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie — never readable by JS, never
  in `localStorage` → `security-review-2026-09.md` "Frontend session-token
  storage checked" (verified 2026-09-02, a deliberate migration away from an
  earlier localStorage-token design) → Residual: the accepted CSP
  `style-src unsafe-inline` finding (`#1273`/`#1302`), investigated and
  accepted as a documented tradeoff, not a regression.
- **CSRF** → A JS-readable double-submit `csrf_token` cookie, correct by
  design for that pattern (carries no authority on its own) →
  `RequireCSRF`/`csrf.go` → Residual: none identified.
- **Tampering with client-side state** → `zustand` `persist` in `localStorage`
  holds only non-credential bookkeeping (profile, expiry timestamps for UX) →
  verified by reading `web/src/store/authStore.ts` directly → Residual: none
  identified; the rest of the frontend beyond CSP and token storage is
  explicitly out of scope for the 2026-09 review and scheduled as its own
  future pass.

### B6 — Kubernetes delivery (sync agent / operator / ESO)

- **Elevation of privilege via over-broad RBAC** → The operator defaults to a
  single-namespace `Role`/`RoleBinding`, least-privilege by default; broader
  scopes are explicit opt-ins resolved from one shared helper so they can
  never disagree (ADR-076) → `docs/k8s-operator.md` → Residual: an operator
  who opts into cluster-wide watch accepts a correspondingly larger RBAC
  surface — a documented, deliberate tradeoff, not a silent default.
- **Tampering / partial writes** → A fetch failure never writes a partial
  Secret; it records `Ready=False`/`SyncError` and backs off → `docs/k8s-operator.md`
  "How it works" → Residual: none identified.
- **Information disclosure** → All three delivery mechanisms (operator, sync
  agent, ESO) read over the same authorized API, honoring `max_reads`,
  suspension, and audit, and never log values → `docs/k8s-operator.md` →
  Residual: none identified.

### B7 — External connectors, rotation targets, KMS

- **Server-side request forgery (SSRF)** → Link-local/NAT64 address guards on
  outbound connector/dynamic-secret calls → `internal/netutil`,
  `internal/core/dynamic_secrets_ssrf_test.go`, `internal/core/admin_dsn_ssrf_fuzz_test.go`
  → Residual: none identified in the reviewed surfaces; this is an
  actively-fuzzed boundary (`FuzzAzureGenerateUpstreamRef`, `FuzzPostgresQuoting`,
  `FuzzMySQLQuoteString` — the exact class that already produced one real,
  shipped, fixed path-traversal vulnerability in `rotation_ref` handling,
  now additionally denylist-validated at configuration time).
- **Cross-tenant leakage via Connect** → Connectors are scoped to
  `(scope, project, environment)`, with ownership enforcement and
  `ListConnectors` filtering by the caller's authorized scope, plus a
  dedicated `connect.platform.use` permission gated as a **terminal deny**
  with no delegation fallback (ADR-082, all four implementation branches
  shipped) → Residual: none identified after ADR-082's three rounds of
  revision; the ADR's own "Out of scope" section names what is deliberately
  deferred to later implementation work — see that document directly for the
  exact boundary.
- **Signing-key MITM (OIDC/federation)** → `jwks_uri` must be `https` (loopback
  exempted for local development only); asymmetric-only algorithm allowlist
  (`HS*`/`none` rejected); issuer allowlist checked *before* key retrieval →
  `SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md` "ICT third-party risk / federation trust
  boundary" → Residual: none identified.

### B8 — Admin host access

Covered in depth in §5.1 (insider / host-root) below — the short version:
host access to `keyorix-server admin …` **is** the authority these commands
grant, by design (ADR-108 decision B: "these need shell access on the server
host plus the DB and key files; owning the host is the authority"). The
threat-modeling question is not "can host root do damage" (yes, always,
everywhere) but "does anything on this boundary silently grant *more* than
host access already implies" — traced in §5.1 and found: no, with one
explicit, accepted exception (the keyless recovery mode, opt-in only).

### B9 — Backups

Covered in §5.3.

### B10 — Supply chain

Covered in §5.4.

## 5. Cross-cutting scenarios

### 5.1 Insider threat and host-root

The load-bearing distinction Keyorix draws, consistently, is **where the KEK
lives**:

- **KEK as a local file** (`key_provider.type: file`) — host root already has
  everything: the ciphertext, the wrapped DEK, and the KEK-derivation
  material. No control at the application layer changes this; it is stated
  plainly rather than implied
  (`docs/design-b2-recover-admin.md` §1: *"this recovery key does not protect
  your secrets from root — it protects your admin account from anyone who is
  not you"*).
- **KEK in a KMS/HSM/TPM** (`aws-kms`/`gcp-kms`/`azure-kms`/`tpm`) — host root
  can read ciphertext but cannot unwrap secrets without also compromising the
  external KMS/HSM boundary. Here, application-layer controls (the recovery
  key, MFA, session revocation) are doing real, additional work against a
  host-compromise actor, not just against a stolen-credential actor.

**Break-glass admin recovery** (`keyorix-server admin recover-admin`,
`internal/recoverykey`, `server/admin/recover_admin.go`) is the concrete
mechanism this boundary runs through:

| Actor | Outcome | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Host root, no recovery key, default (required) mode | Cannot recover | The stored value is a one-way SHA-256 verifier (`internal/storage/store/local_recovery_key.go`) — root can overwrite it, not derive the key from it. |
| Recovery key holder, no host access | Cannot recover | `recover-admin` is a local subcommand, never a network endpoint (ADR-108 B) — a key with no shell on the host is inert. |
| Host root **and** the recovery key | Can recover | This is the accepted ceiling for a local break-glass tool, not a gap: two independent factors is the strongest practical bar. The residual control is *detectability* — every use is written to the audit chain and triggers an admin notification, making the act visible and attributable even though it can't be prevented. |
| Keyless mode explicitly enabled | Host root alone recovers | An opt-in-only labs/demo escape hatch that deliberately collapses "host access" and "admin access" into one boundary — cannot be enabled remotely, and its reachability is itself guarded by a dedicated test (`internal/config/keyless_mode_reachability_test.go`). |

This mirrors ADR-108's broader design choice: admin-recovery, offline backup/
restore, and version-skipping upgrades are all `keyorix-server admin`
subcommands rather than network endpoints, specifically because a network path
to any of them would be a built-in authentication bypass.

### 5.2 The CLI local-mode gap (repeated from §4, stated once more for visibility)

This is the one place today's implementation genuinely falls short of the
product's own stated authorization model, and it is called out three times in
this document deliberately (§3 table, §4 B1/B2, here) because it is easy to
undersell by mentioning it once in a large table. CLI local mode is a second,
unaudited, unrate-limited path into the same database the API protects. ADR-108
(Accepted, not yet implemented beyond early measurement steps) removes it. Until
it ships, an operator who wants the authorization model this threat model
otherwise describes to be complete must not grant local-mode CLI access to
anyone who shouldn't also have direct database access — because, today, that's
exactly what it is.

### 5.3 Stolen backup

Today, backup is operator-driven, not a Keyorix-native artifact: a `pg_dump` of
the database plus a `tar` of the key-material volume
([`../SELF_HOSTING.md`](../SELF_HOSTING.md) §5). This has a direct threat-model
consequence, stated plainly rather than left implicit:

- **A stolen database dump alone** is encrypted ciphertext under a DEK that is
  itself wrapped by the KEK — unreadable without the key material.
- **A stolen key-material volume alone** is useless without the database it
  wraps keys for.
- **Both together, plus `KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD`** (or the file/fd/stdin
  passphrase source, ADR-099) — for a file-KEK install, this is a complete
  offline compromise, equivalent to host root (§5.1). For a KMS/HSM-backed
  install, the attacker still needs the external KMS boundary, so a stolen
  backup pair alone is *not* sufficient.

No dedicated backup encryption format, integrity check, or restore-time
verification exists yet as a Keyorix feature — this is accurately described as
an operator-owned procedure today, tracked as future work under the BACKUP
track's ownership of `server/admin/backup*.go`/`restore*.go` (not yet present
in the tree as of this writing). This document will be updated once that
lands.

### 5.4 Rollback and downgrade

A binary older than the database it's pointed at could, before ADR-097,
silently run against schema state it doesn't understand — for example, an
older binary unaware of `roles.bypasses_permission_checks` writing a new row
without it, or unaware of `audit_events.prev_hash`/`entry_hash` breaking the
tamper-evidence chain. ADR-097's `checkSchemaEpoch`/`recordSchemaEpoch`
(`internal/storage/factory.go`) makes this a **loud startup refusal** rather
than a silent behavioral gap — tracing every security-relevant column added to
date confirmed each one defaults in the safe direction for an old binary, and
the schema-epoch guard now makes that hold structurally rather than by each
migration author's individual discipline (`security-review-2026-09.md`
"Update, 2026-09-02" §"Migration downgrade paths").

### 5.5 Supply chain

Eleven required CI status checks gate every merge to `main`, with no bypass —
`govulncheck` (known-vulnerability gate, checked on every PR), `gosec` +
`golangci-lint` (static analysis), `go test -race` (the full suite including
security regressions), `go vet`, `gitleaks` (PR-scoped secret history scan),
`CodeQL` (cross-function taint tracking, both Go modules), `checkov` (Helm
chart security-policy scanning), `go-licenses` (dependency license
compliance — the allowlist was derived from the actual dependency tree and
verified to genuinely fail on an injected AGPL test dependency), fuzz-target
staleness (bidirectional: a target that exists but isn't declared would
otherwise silently never run), and DCO sign-off. Full detail and the hardening
log behind each gate: [`../compliance/SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md`](../compliance/SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md).
Release artifacts (the `keyorix-server` image and the `charts/keyorix` OCI
chart) publish to `ghcr.io` via `.github/workflows/release.yml` and
`docker-publish.yml`; verify a specific published artifact with `helm pull`
against the OCI reference directly, not the GitHub packages API (the latter
does not reliably enumerate OCI-chart artifacts).

## 6. Residual risks, stated honestly

Carried forward from `security-review-2026-09.md` rather than re-litigated:

- **Transient in-process secret-value exposure.** Every secret-VALUE plaintext
  accumulates at least three unwiped heap copies between decryption and the
  wire (the `gcm.Open` output, a `string()` conversion, and a JSON/protobuf
  serialization buffer) — structural to Go strings' immutability and
  `encoding/json`'s API, not a missed call site. Closing it would mean
  threading `[]byte`-only plaintext through the entire read path. **Not
  fixed; recorded as an open design gap**, not a code defect.
- **`KEYORIX_MASTER_PASSWORD` cannot be wiped** — string-shaped from
  `os.Getenv` onward, and Go strings cannot be zeroed once created. The
  *sourcing* half is fixed (ADR-099: `--passphrase-fd`/`--passphrase-file`/
  `--passphrase-stdin` all yield a wipeable `[]byte`; the env var is the
  documented weakest, last-resort fallback). The wiping gap for
  `PasswordKeyProvider`'s own long-lived string stays open **by design** — it
  can legitimately be asked for the KEK a second time during in-process
  rotation, so wiping after the first call would break the second.
- **Authentication cache window (~30s).** A revoked token or suspended
  account can remain valid for up to this TTL; logout and password-change
  evict immediately, and suspension purges DB sessions immediately — the
  cached-validity window is the only lag. A documented tradeoff, tunable by
  reducing the TTL.
- **CLI local mode bypasses API-layer authorization, audit, and rate
  limiting** (§5.2) — the largest open item in this document, with a shipped
  ADR (108) and a program not yet complete.
- **API response wire-hygiene** — an open, in-progress internal finding
  (§4, B3/B4 information-disclosure row) covering PascalCase/snake_case
  inconsistency and, more seriously, PII (`IPAddress`) leaking via two
  specific audit/access-log routes where a sibling route already redacts it.
  Not yet closed as of this writing.
- **No dedicated backup-artifact encryption/integrity mechanism** (§5.3) —
  today's backup procedure is operator-driven `pg_dump` + key-volume copy,
  not a Keyorix-native, verifiable artifact.
- **On-box audit-chain enforcement can be neutralized by a DB-level actor who
  can also write `audit_checkpoints`** — deleting or overwriting the latest
  checkpoint row forces `verify` to fail closed (report invalid) until the
  next scheduler re-baseline; within that window a truncation could be
  re-blessed. What such an actor can never do is *forge* a checkpoint that
  makes a truncated chain verify as valid (the HMAC key is never in the
  database) — detection in that scenario reverts to an off-box external
  anchor (ADR-029, "Residual (honest scope)").

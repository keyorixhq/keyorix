# Secure Development Policy

> **Positioning.** This is a factual account of what actually happens in this
> repository today, not an aspirational policy document. Every claim below
> cites the file, workflow, or live GitHub API response that proves it, and
> every claim is marked **in place** (with evidence) or **planned** (not yet
> true). Where an earlier document overstated something — most notably a
> repeated "no bypass, including for maintainers" claim that turned out not
> to match the live branch-protection ruleset — that correction is recorded
> here and cross-linked from the corrected documents, not quietly dropped.
> Companion documents: [`testing.md`](testing.md) (CI gates and the fuzzing
> programme, in depth), [`threat-model.md`](threat-model.md) and
> [`threat-models/`](threat-models/) (what's defended against),
> [`SECURE-CODING.md`](SECURE-CODING.md) (the coding rules this policy's
> gates exist to enforce).

## Branch protection

**In place, with one gap and one honest caveat — read via the live API, not
assumed:**

```
$ gh api repos/keyorixhq/keyorix/rulesets --jq '.[] | {name,target,enforcement}'
{"enforcement":"disabled","name":"Code Quality Copilot review for default branch","target":"branch"}
{"enforcement":"active","name":"Require core CI checks on main","target":"branch"}

$ gh api repos/keyorixhq/keyorix/rulesets/<id> --jq '.rules[].type'
required_status_checks
merge_queue

$ gh api repos/keyorixhq/keyorix/branches/main/protection
{"message":"Branch not protected", ...}  # 404 — this repo uses Rulesets, not classic branch protection
```

- **Required status checks (in place).** The active ruleset names 18
  required status-check contexts: `build-and-test`, `static-analysis`,
  `lint`, `licenses`, `fuzz-targets`, `fuzz-reach`, `adr-numbers`,
  `exclusion-freshness`, `assert-leg-completeness`, `base-branch-check`,
  `gitleaks`, `helm-chart`, `helm-chart-security`, `operator`,
  `pnpm-workspace-root-guard`, `workflow-lint`, `dco-check`,
  `security-fix-regression-check`. These are CI job names from `ci.yml` and
  sibling workflows; [`testing.md`](testing.md) groups the underlying tools
  (`govulncheck`, `gosec`, `golangci-lint`, `go test -race`, `go vet`,
  `gitleaks`, `CodeQL`, `checkov`, `go-licenses`, fuzz-target staleness,
  DCO) conceptually — the two lists describe the same gate at different
  levels, not two different gates.
- **Merge queue (in place).** `grouping_strategy: ALLGREEN`,
  `merge_method: SQUASH`, `max_entries_to_build: 4`,
  `max_entries_to_merge: 5`, `check_response_timeout_minutes: 180`. Every
  merge to `main` goes through the queue; nothing merges directly.
- **Bypass actor — a real gap, not a hypothetical (corrected 2026-10-05).**
  The ruleset's `bypass_actors` carries one entry:
  `{"actor_type":"OrganizationAdmin","bypass_mode":"always"}`. Several
  existing documents (`SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `docs/security/testing.md`, `docs/security/threat-model.md`,
  `docs/compliance/SECURITY-VERIFICATION.md`) previously stated flatly that
  there is "no bypass, including for maintainers." That was not accurate,
  and all five have been corrected in the same PR that adds this document
  (cross-referencing here) rather than left to quietly contradict this
  page. **NEEDS ANDREI**: is the org-admin bypass intentional (a genuine
  break-glass path for an outage where CI itself is broken), or should it
  be removed? This document does not change the ruleset — that's a live
  GitHub setting change, out of scope for a docs-only pass, and a judgment
  call about operational risk that isn't this document's to make.
- **Required reviewer — planned, not in place.** `.github/CODEOWNERS`
  designates `@aibeshkov` as the intended reviewer for cryptography, auth/
  RBAC, middleware, storage migrations, the CI/CD pipeline, and this policy
  itself. Reading the ruleset directly shows **no required-reviewer rule
  exists** — the two rules are `required_status_checks` and `merge_queue`
  only, and classic branch protection reports "Branch not protected" (404).
  CODEOWNERS today documents intended ownership; GitHub does not block a
  merge on it. See "Review flow" below for why this has not mattered in
  practice so far, and why it's still listed as a gap rather than closed.

## DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)

**In place.** `dco-check` is one of the 18 required status-check contexts
above; the workflow is [`.github/workflows/dco.yml`](../../.github/workflows/dco.yml).
Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` trailer matching its author
(`git commit -s`); `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents this for external
contributors.

## Review flow

**Stated honestly, per this policy's own positioning:** Keyorix is written
by one person, Andrei Beshkov, using Claude Code AI coding sessions under
his direct, same-day supervision — he reviews and signs off on what merges;
there is no separate human reviewer today. This is verifiable, not asserted:
of the last 1000 commits on `main`, 939 are authored by Andrei Beshkov and
61 by `dependabot[bot]` (`git log --format='%an' -1000 | sort | uniq -c`) —
every human-authored commit in that window is his; there is no second
human account in the history to review against. `CODEOWNERS` names him as the designated reviewer for every
security-sensitive path listed above.

**A human second reviewer for crypto/auth/audit changes is a stated goal,
not a current practice.** Today's actual second-opinion mechanism is
process, not personnel: a documented adversarial-review campaign
(`keyorix-private/adversarial-review/`, referenced throughout this
codebase's ADRs and ADR-conformance ledger), AI-assisted review sessions
distinct from the implementing session, and the machine-checked ledgers
(`docs/review-coverage.tsv`, `docs/security-closures.tsv`,
`docs/adr-conformance-enforced.tsv`, all three CI-enforced — see
[`testing.md`](testing.md) §4) that make "was this reviewed" and "is this
fix real" checkable rather than a matter of recollection. None of that is a
substitute for an independent second human reviewer with standing to block
a merge; this document does not claim it is.

## CI gates

**In place.** Full list, what each gate catches, and the hardening log
behind each one (what it has actually caught, not just what it's designed
to catch): [`testing.md`](testing.md) §1. Not repeated here to avoid two
documents drifting out of sync on the same list.

## Fuzzing programme

**In place.** Per-PR/weekly bounded fuzzing plus a continuous-discovery rig
on dedicated infrastructure; harness quality gates (reach/coverage-delta,
rediscovery); 93 declared `FuzzXxx` targets as of `testing.md`'s writing,
bidirectionally checked against `scripts/fuzzing/targets.d/` by CI. Full
detail: [`testing.md`](testing.md) §2.

**Embargo handling (in place).** Per `testing.md`'s own positioning note:
findings against embargoed third-party libraries (at this writing,
`crewjam/saml` and `digitorus/pkcs7`, embargoed until upstream disclosure)
are not detailed in any public document — only the *mechanism* that would
catch or has caught such issues is described, never the specific finding,
until the upstream advisory ships.

## Dependency policy

**In place.**

- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`): monthly, with a 7-day
  cooldown, across four ecosystems (`github-actions`, `gomod` root,
  `gomod` operator, `npm` web, `npm` root). Patch/minor bumps are grouped
  per ecosystem to avoid one-PR-per-bump CI cost; majors are left
  individual since they can be breaking. GitHub Actions are pinned to full
  commit SHAs specifically so Dependabot's SHA-bump support (not tag
  tracking) is what keeps them current — see the file's own header comment
  for why an ungrouped `codeql-action` bump broke CI twice (#1257, #1260)
  before the grouping was added.
- **`govulncheck`** runs on every PR/push touching Go code (`static-analysis`
  job) *and* on a standalone weekly schedule
  (`.github/workflows/govulncheck-scheduled.yml`, Fridays, matching
  OSV-Scanner's cadence) — closing the gap where a new entry lands in
  `vuln.go.dev` for a symbol this code already calls, between two PRs that
  happen not to touch Go.
- **OSV-Scanner** (`.github/workflows/osv-scanner.yml`) — PR/push plus the
  same weekly schedule, a second, independently-sourced vulnerability
  database from `govulncheck`'s.
- **Trivy** (`.github/workflows/trivy.yml`) and **OSSF Scorecard**
  (`.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`) — container/dependency scanning and
  supply-chain posture scoring respectively.
- **`go-licenses`** (one of the 18 required contexts, as `licenses`) rejects
  any dependency outside an explicit permissive allowlist (MIT/Apache-2.0/
  BSD-2/3-Clause/ISC/MPL-2.0) — the allowlist was derived from the real
  dependency tree and verified to fail on an injected AGPL test dependency
  (see `testing.md` §1).

## Release signing, SBOM, and SLSA provenance

**In place.** Verification commands and the full design are published in
[`../../SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) § Verifying a Release; summarized
here with the workflow evidence:

- **Keyless signing**: `checksums.txt` and every container image are signed
  with Sigstore/cosign via GitHub's OIDC token (`sigstore/cosign-installer`
  in both `release.yml` and `docker-publish.yml`) — no long-lived signing
  key exists to leak.
- **SLSA build provenance**: `actions/attest-build-provenance` runs in both
  `release.yml` and `docker-publish.yml` (ADR-109 step 6), a second,
  independent mechanism from the cosign signature — an in-toto statement
  GitHub itself attests to, naming the exact workflow run, inputs, and
  builder identity. Verifiable with `gh attestation verify`, not just
  `cosign`.
- **SBOM**: `docker-publish.yml` emits BuildKit-native `provenance:
  mode=max` / `sbom: true` attestations pushed alongside each image;
  `release.yml` generates a CycloneDX SBOM per release binary (15 total
  across CLI/server/server-airgap/keyorix-migrate × platform/arch, per
  `SECURITY.md`); `anchore-syft.yml` additionally runs an SPDX-format SBOM
  scan (`sbom.spdx.json`) as its own CI artifact.

## Remediation SLA

**In place.** [ADR-104](../adr-104-security-remediation-sla.md) is the
internal-target and CRITICAL-definition document;
[`../../SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) § Remediation Timelines is the
authoritative published commitment (the two are deliberately split by
authority — ADR-104 itself says so — and `SECURITY.md` wins if they ever
disagree). Headline: 48h acknowledge, 7d initial assessment, 90-day ceiling
across all severities (not severity-tiered — ADR-104's Context section
explains why a severity-tiered deadline was tried first and abandoned),
1-week advance notice for High/Critical before a security release ships,
GHSA-with-CVE same day as the fix.

## Merge queue and mis-based-merge detection

**In place**, with a known structural limitation that is itself documented
rather than hidden. The merge queue (above) is the admission mechanism. A
separate, scheduled workflow,
[`mis-based-merge-detector.yml`](../../.github/workflows/mis-based-merge-detector.yml),
exists because `base-branch-check` (a required status check) turned out to
be **structurally unable to block a mis-based merge**: it only runs on
`pull_request` events and only fails when a PR's base isn't `main`, but
required-check enforcement only applies on `main` itself — so a PR based on
some other branch and merged there was never actually gated by it (verified
directly: PR #1609 merged mis-based with `base-branch-check` red). The
detector workflow is hourly, scans merged PRs in a lookback window, and
fails + files an issue for any whose base wasn't `main` — detection within
the hour instead of the days it took to notice #1563–#1566 and #1594
manually. It is deliberately *not* added to the required-checks list, for
the reason given in its own file header: doing so would recreate the exact
false reassurance `base-branch-check` already gave for weeks.

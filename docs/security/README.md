# Keyorix Security Documentation

> **Positioning.** This is the index into every security document this
> repository maintains. Every claim in every linked document cites the
> code, test, ADR, or live CI/GitHub-API evidence behind it — this page
> does not restate those claims, only points to where they live. See
> [`../../SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) for the vulnerability
> disclosure policy (the document GitHub's Security tab surfaces) and
> [`../compliance/README.md`](../compliance/README.md) for the
> regulatory-framework control mappings built on top of everything here.

## Contents

| Document | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`SECURITY-MODEL.md`](SECURITY-MODEL.md) | One-page public summary in the Vault/OpenBao/Infisical format: goals, in scope, explicit out-of-scope list, trust assumptions. Start here. |
| [`threat-model.md`](threat-model.md) | System-wide threat model: assets, trust boundaries, STRIDE per boundary, residual risks — the longest-standing, most-reviewed source; per-component documents below narrow this, never override it. |
| [`threat-models/`](threat-models/README.md) | Twelve per-component threat models (server API, authentication, authorization/RBAC, audit chain, secret storage + key hierarchy, backup/restore, update bundles, connectors, Kubernetes operator, web UI, HA consistency, MCP server), each with a data-flow diagram and a VSO-style threat table (ID/STRIDE/Description/Mitigation/Evidence link/Residual-or-GAP). |
| [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) | How encryption, authentication, authorization, transport, process hardening, and air-gap operation actually work, with code/ADR citations for each mechanism. |
| [`hardening-guide.md`](hardening-guide.md) | A production configuration checklist with the exact config keys, verified against `internal/config`. |
| [`SDLC.md`](SDLC.md) | Secure development policy: branch protection (read live via `gh api`), DCO, review flow, CI gates, fuzzing, dependency policy, release signing/SBOM/SLSA, remediation SLA, merge queue — each item marked in place (with evidence) or planned. |
| [`SECURE-CODING.md`](SECURE-CODING.md) | Ten coding rules this codebase actually enforces, each with the real finding that motivated it and the guard/test that keeps it true. |
| [`testing.md`](testing.md) | CI gates in depth, the fuzzing programme, differential/property testing, and the machine-checked coverage ledgers. |

## Related, one level up

| Document | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`../../SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) | Vulnerability disclosure: how to report, response targets, safe harbor, remediation SLA, release-verification commands. |
| [`../../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) | What CI checks and what's required to contribute (overlaps `SDLC.md`'s branch-protection section; `SDLC.md` is the more detailed, evidence-linked version). |
| [`../compliance/README.md`](../compliance/README.md) | NIS2/DORA/ISO 27001/ENS/SOC 2/BSI APP.bd.6 control mappings built on the controls documented here. |

## For buyers: control → evidence

One page, no prose — each row is a claim a vendor-security-review
questionnaire typically asks about, and the exact artifact that proves
it. If a link 404s or a cited test doesn't exist, that's a bug in this
table — file an issue; don't take the row on faith.

Two rows above are deliberately phrased as "honestly scoped" rather than
"in place" — a prior version of several documents in this repository
overstated branch-protection and code-owner-review enforcement, found
and corrected while writing this evidence pack (2026-10-05). They're
listed here rather than omitted, consistent with this repository's own
stated engineering principle: a claim with no mechanism that fails when
it stops being true is a comment, however carefully written — and an
overstated claim, once found, gets corrected in place, not quietly
dropped from a buyer-facing table.

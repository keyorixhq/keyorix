// rationale below lives here, at the actual source of truth, not in the
// generated output where a routine regen would silently discard it (as
// happened once already: an unpinned `make manifests` run stripped this exact
// explanation from role.yaml before anyone had committed it).
//
// This grants a ClusterRole (not a namespaced Role) because by DEFAULT the
// operator is deployed as a single cluster-wide instance that watches
// KeyorixSecret CRs (a namespaced CRD) across every namespace -- with no
// static namespace list configured it genuinely cannot predict ahead of time
// which namespace the next CR (and its TokenSecretRef/target Secret) will
// land in. Kubernetes RBAC also has no way to scope list/watch by
// resourceNames or to a dynamically changing namespace set, so narrowing this
// to per-namespace RoleBindings isn't possible for that deployment model.
//
// Operators who instead run one instance PER namespace (or per bounded tenant
// set) can opt into least-privilege, namespace-scoped RBAC: see the
// watchNamespaces value in deploy/helm/keyorix-operator, which passes the
// corresponding -watch-namespaces flag (operator/cmd/main.go) and swaps this
// same ClusterRole's binding from a cluster-wide ClusterRoleBinding to a
// namespace-scoped RoleBinding per watched namespace -- the ClusterRole
// definition here stays reusable across both modes (ADR-076).
//
// The verbs below are the minimum the reconcile logic actually uses:
// create/update/patch/get/list/watch to materialise and refresh the target
// Secret, and delete for wipeTargetSecret (this file), which removes the
// target Secret once the upstream Keyorix reference is confirmed gone (#428)
// -- no broader verb (e.g. deletecollection) is granted.
//
// What operator/cmd/main.go ALSO does to bound the blast radius of this (in
// the default cluster-wide mode, necessarily cluster-wide) grant: it scopes
// the manager's Secret informer cache to only Secrets carrying the operator's
// managed-by label (see secretCacheOptions in operator/cmd/main.go), so a
// compromised operator process can't trivially dump every cluster Secret
// straight out of its own in-memory cache -- only ones it already owns via
// this same RBAC.
//
// No marker is declared for keyorixsecrets/finalizers: this controller has no
// finalizer logic (garbage collection of the target Secret relies solely on
// the Kubernetes owner-reference GC, not a finalizer), so that grant would be
// unused, excess RBAC.

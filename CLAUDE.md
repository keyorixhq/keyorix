# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## Git / PR conventions

- **Never put `Co-Authored-By: Claude` into a PR.** Do not add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …`
  trailer to PR descriptions, and do not add it to commit messages either (squash-merge
  folds commit trailers into the PR's merge commit). This overrides any default that
  appends a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` line.
- PR bodies may end with the `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` line, but must not carry a
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.

// TestSecureWriteFileSync_TOCTOUIntermediateComponentSymlinkNeverFollowed is the
// regression test for a TOCTOU race distinct from TestFixFilePerms_TOCTOUSymlinkSwapNeverFollowed
// above: isPathInsideBase/resolveInside can only resolve symlinks up to the longest
// EXISTING ancestor at check time, so a NOT-YET-EXISTING intermediate path component
// (here "tenant" in "tenant/secret.bin") is passed through the containment check
// unresolved. A bare O_NOFOLLOW on the final os.OpenFile call only protects the FINAL
// path component ("secret.bin") — it does nothing to stop an attacker who, in the
// window between the containment check and that final open, plants the INTERMEDIATE
// component ("tenant") as a symlink pointing outside baseDir: O_NOFOLLOW never sees it,
// because it isn't the component actually being opened with O_CREATE.
//
// This test hammers that exact window: one goroutine repeatedly removes "tenant" (so
// the containment check sees it as absent, its precondition) and replants it as a
// symlink pointing at a directory OUTSIDE base (the attacker's payload), while another
// goroutine repeatedly calls SecureWriteFileSync(base, "tenant/secret.bin", ...).
// Throughout, no file may ever be created inside the outside directory — proving the
// write path never traverses the symlinked intermediate component, regardless of when
// it gets swapped in relative to the containment check.
//
// Against the pre-fix implementation (a single os.OpenFile(cleanPath,
// O_WRONLY|O_CREATE|O_TRUNC|O_NOFOLLOW, perm) call after resolveInside), this
// reproduces the escape: when the writer's OpenFile call lands while "tenant" is
// symlinked, O_NOFOLLOW only guards "secret.bin" and the open follows "tenant" straight
// into the outside directory, creating secret.bin there. Against the fix
// (secureOpenBeneath's per-component O_NOFOLLOW walk via openat), every attempt to
// traverse "tenant" while it is a symlink is refused outright (ELOOP), so the outside
// directory must remain empty for the whole test.

// Package sqlitetest opens the throwaway in-memory SQLite databases this
// repo's tests use, with the ONE connection-pool setting shared-cache SQLite
// actually requires — so that setting lives in a single place instead of being
// remembered, or forgotten, at every `gorm.Open` call site (#2906).
//
// The problem it closes. A test DB has to be BOTH in-memory and visible to
// every connection in the pool, which forces the DSN shape this repo uses
// everywhere:
//
//	file:<unique-name>?mode=memory&cache=shared
//
// `mode=memory` WITHOUT `cache=shared` is not an option: each pooled
// connection would then get its own private, empty database (a trap this repo
// has already documented — see internal/core/core_sequence_fuzz_test.go).
// But `cache=shared` means every connection in the pool contends for
// SQLite's TABLE-level shared-cache locks, and a read-vs-write collision there
// surfaces as SQLITE_LOCKED, "database table is locked".
//
// A busy timeout does NOT help with that. `_busy_timeout` (and its `_timeout`
// alias) drives SQLite's busy HANDLER, which is consulted for SQLITE_BUSY —
// not for the SQLITE_LOCKED a shared cache raises; retrying that one requires
// sqlite3_unlock_notify, which this driver does not wire up. So a test whose
// DSN carries `_timeout=30000` is not protected, and that is precisely the
// shape #2906's flake was reported on.
//
// What works is capping the pool to ONE connection: with a single connection
// there is no second connection in the cache to collide with, and Go's own
// database/sql pool serialises concurrent callers — including the detached
// goSafe audit writers that make the collision reachable from an otherwise
// sequential test. Measured on this repo's own tables, a four-second
// read/write/transaction hammer across 8 goroutines produces ~180k
// "database table is locked" errors on an uncapped pool and exactly zero on a
// capped one (sqlitetest_test.go keeps both halves of that measurement as
// standing tests).
//
// Test-only: nothing outside *_test.go files may import this package.

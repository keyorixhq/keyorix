// Package besteffortguard is the AST scanner behind the best-effort-after-commit
// structural guard (GUARD-1, #2561). It is test-support code: the three
// packages that run the guard (internal/core, server/http/handlers,
// server/grpc/services) import it from their own _test.go files only, so it is
// never linked into the server binary.
//
// # What the guard is for
//
// QA-1 found the same defect 12+ times, one call site at a time: a best-effort
// step that runs AFTER a storage write has already committed (evict a cache,
// notify an admin, emit an audit event) panics, the panic escapes, and the
// caller reports failure for an operation that actually succeeded. The guard
// makes the shape structural rather than something a reviewer has to spot: a
// call whose result is dropped, textually after the last storage write in the
// same function, must either be routed through goSafe/besteffort.Run (which
// recover) or carry a reviewed exemption saying why its callee already
// recovers internally.
//
// # Why this lives in one package instead of three copies
//
// It used to be three near-identical copies of one AST walk, differing only in
// a receiver-field name. #2561's review required a type-of-callee lookup, a
// planted-positive fixture and a stale-exemption check on top of that, which is
// more logic than is sensible to maintain in triplicate. The per-package
// differences are now Options fields.
//
// # What this scanner does NOT see
//
// Stated explicitly, because a guard that is silent about its blind spots is
// how the previous version came to be trusted further than it had earned
// (CLAUDE.md: "Ask of any mechanism: what does it silently skip, and does it
// say so?"). In particular:
//
//   - It is CONTROL-FLOW BLIND. "After the last write" is textual position, so
//     a discard in one arm of a mutually-exclusive if/else is flagged exactly
//     like a true sequential case. Same documented caveat as
//     atomicity_guard_test.go's write-count scan.
//   - It is CALLER-SIDE ONLY. It cannot see that a callee recovers its own
//     panic; that is precisely what the exemption file records.
//   - It scans only *.go files DIRECTLY under the root, not subpackages.
//   - Its "is this a storage write" test is a verb-prefix regex on the method
//     name (optionally restricted to one receiver field), not a type-checked
//     resolution to a storage interface method.
//   - For bare calls, it resolves the callee's return arity only for functions
//     and methods DECLARED IN THE SCANNED PACKAGE, by the three call forms
//     listed on resolveLocalReturns. A call it cannot resolve is not flagged,
//     so this half of the guard under-reports by construction rather than
//     guessing.
//   - panicSafetyIndex resolves a callee by its BARE name only, never by
//     receiver type -- two methods on different types sharing a name are the
//     SAME entry in the index (#2561 round 2). A collision resolves toward
//     unsafe (every declaration sharing the name must itself be safe), which
//     is the conservative direction, but it also means a genuinely-safe
//     method can be denied the derivation solely because an unrelated,
//     unsafe, same-named method exists elsewhere in the same package -- that
//     site would then need a reviewed exemption despite being fine on its
//     own. Resolving by (package, receiver type, name) instead would need a
//     type-checked pass this scanner does not do.

//
// This is #2561's main structural change, and it is why the exemption file has
// no rows. v1 (and this PR's first draft) recorded "the callee recovers its own
// panic" as a human-vouched exemption ROW. That is strictly weaker than
// deriving it: an exemption keeps pardoning the call site even after someone
// deletes the recover() it was premised on, which is the exact shape of a guard
// that certifies a real bug as correct. Derived, the same fact fails loudly the
// moment it stops being true -- CLAUDE.md's "derive and check it" over "assert
// it in prose".
//
// A function is panic-safe here if its OWN body defers a recover() (directly,
// or via besteffort.RunRecover), OR -- #2561 round 2 -- its ENTIRE body is a
// single statement that does nothing but tail-call another package-local,
// already-safe function (pureTailDelegationCallee). Nothing broader than that
// is transitive.
//
// That restriction is the whole correctness of this index, and it cost a draft
// to learn. The obvious generalisation -- "safe if it CALLS something that
// recovers" -- marked 365 of internal/core's 1430 functions safe, because
// almost every function eventually calls an audit helper that funnels into
// emitAudit's recover(). It is simply false: a recover() in a callee protects
// only that callee. A panic in any other part of the caller's body still
// escapes, so the generalisation would have suppressed exactly the reports this
// guard exists to make.
//
// The pure-tail-delegation exception is narrow enough to not be that bug: it
// requires the body to be NOTHING ELSE -- no argument construction beyond
// forwarding the exact same values, no other statement before or after. A
// wrapper shaped that way adds zero panic surface of its own, so its safety
// is IDENTICAL to its sole callee's, not inferred from a pattern that could
// coexist with real, unprotected risk elsewhere in a larger body. Added when
// main's #2827 turned writeAuditEventFull/writeAuditEventDiff into exactly
// this shape (-> writeAuditEventFullOn/writeAuditEventDiffOn) and moved the
// #2561 recover to the new choke point (writeAuditEventDiffOn, which now
// protects its own argument/struct construction too, unlike the pre-#2827
// writeAuditEventDiff this comment used to cite as the reason an exemption
// was still needed) -- without it, those two thin wrappers regressed to
// "not derived-safe" despite genuinely being so, which would have reopened
// 42 call sites across internal/core to either a real fix or a reviewed
// exemption for a risk that no longer exists.

// keySetMtimeTolerance is how far apart two files WITHIN THE SAME key-file
// group (see keyEstablishingGroups) may be modified before
// VerifyKeySetConsistency flags the group as mixed from different
// generations. Generous on purpose: every legitimate path that writes a whole
// group together writes it within one operation, seconds apart at most.
//
// BEST-EFFORT, and deliberately not claimed as a guarantee anywhere —
// docs/adr-conformance-enforced.d/ only asserts the presence/absence half.
// An mtime gap is weak evidence in BOTH directions:
//
//   - A set genuinely assembled from two different backups usually shows NO
//     gap. `cp`, `install`, `docker cp` and `kubectl cp` all stamp the
//     destination with the current time, so the most common ways an operator
//     hand-assembles a key directory erase exactly the signal this looks for.
//     (`cp -p`, `rsync -a` and `tar -xp` do preserve mtimes, which is the
//     narrow case where it helps.)
//   - mtime is freely writable by anyone who can write the file, so it is no
//     evidence at all against a deliberate attacker.
//
// So this catches an honest mistake in a preserving-copy workflow, and
// nothing more. The real fix is an atomically written key-set manifest
// (generation id plus per-file hash) verified at boot — see #2900 — which
// does not depend on filesystem metadata at all.

// Grouping per OPERATION, not across the whole set, is the correction to this

// oldest one in the set produced a false refusal on an ordinary, documented
// rotation: commitNewKEKFiles (`keyorix encryption rotate-kek`) rewrites only
// the salt and the DEK, so a deployment with a passphrase KEK plus a
// KMS/TPM/Shamir fallback leaves that fallback's wrapped-key blob at its
// original age. Weeks later the gap exceeds any tolerance and the server
// refuses to boot, having been asked to do nothing unusual. A check that
// fails closed on an intended operation does not make a deployment safer; it
// gets switched off.
//
// The groups, and why each is one operation:
//
//   - the KEK salt, alone. It is written by first-boot ensureSaltExists and
//     rewritten by commitNewKEKFiles, neither of which touches any provider
//     blob. One member, so nothing to compare — correct, not a gap: the
//     salt's age genuinely carries no information about any other file's.
//   - each write-capable provider's wrapped-KEK blob, alone. Each provider
//     re-wraps its own blob on its own schedule.
//   - each Shamir provider's share files, together. The split writes all
//     shares in one operation, so shares from different generations in one
//     provider really is an inconsistent set — and this is the only group
//     with more than one member, i.e. the only place the mtime check can
//     still say anything.
//
// The DEK is excluded entirely: RotateDEKWithSweep re-wraps it under the SAME
// KEK on its own schedule (ADR-046, or a manual `rotate-dek`) without
// touching anything else, so its age is independent by design.

// VerifyKeySetConsistency is the boot-time key-file-set consistency check.
// Two checks, with deliberately different strengths — and the difference is
// the point, because only one of them is sound enough to be claimed in
// docs/adr-conformance-enforced.d/:
//
//  1. PRESENCE/ABSENCE (the real guarantee). The installed key files must
//     either ALL be present (an already-provisioned deployment) or ALL be
//     absent (a fresh install, about to generate them) — never a PARTIAL set,
//     which no legitimate provisioning path produces. Decidable from os.Stat
//     alone, and unfoolable by how the files were put there.
//
//  2. SAME-GROUP MTIME (best-effort only, NOT a guarantee). Within each group
//     of files one operation writes together (keyEstablishingGroups), ages
//     must fall within keySetMtimeTolerance of the group's oldest. See
//     keySetMtimeTolerance for why this is weak evidence in both directions:
//     plain cp/install/docker cp/kubectl cp erase the signal, and mtime is
//     writable by anyone who can write the file. It is kept because it costs
//     nothing and does catch an honest mistake in a preserving-copy workflow.
//     The mixed-generation guarantee it used to be presented as is gone from
//     the ledger (Andrei, 2026-10-06); #2900 tracks the manifest that can
//     actually provide one.
//
// A leftover "*.pending" rotation-staging sibling is deliberately NOT part of
// the required set (RequiredKeyFilePaths never adds one, unlike Registry), so
// an interrupted rotation cannot be misread as a partial set. The converse —
// detecting that an interrupted rotation left the ACTIVE set incoherent, e.g.
// commitNewKEKFiles crashing after the DEK rename but before the salt rename —
// is out of scope here and is explicitly part of #2900: the two on-disk states
// that matter (harmless abandoned staging vs. a DEK that no longer unwraps
// under the on-disk salt) are indistinguishable from file presence and mtimes
// alone, and need the manifest's per-file hashes to tell apart. Guarded by
// TestVerifyKeySetConsistency_LeftoverPendingFiles_AreNotAPartialSet.
//
// Both checks fail closed, with every file path named — the ADR's own
// wording ("fail closed with a clear message naming the files"). Called
// unconditionally at boot (server/main.go), not gated behind
// security.enable_file_permission_check: a partial key set is not a "weaker
// but working" state the way that flag's other checks guard — it is already
// broken, just not yet in a way that has surfaced.

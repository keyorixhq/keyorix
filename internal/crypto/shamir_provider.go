// kekShareMagic frames a KEK before splitting so a reconstruction can be checked:
// it precedes the embedded threshold and the KEK bytes in the split payload. A
// reconstruction from too-few/wrong shares yields garbage whose first bytes will
// not equal the magic, so combineKEK rejects it — making sub-threshold unseal
// fail closed even on a FRESH install (where there is no existing wrapped DEK to
// fail against). The byte after the magic carries the threshold K so the provider
// can enforce that at least K shares were actually supplied.
//
// #429: this magic is NOT a cryptographic integrity check and must never be relied
// on as one. Because each byte of the split payload is the constant term of an
// INDEPENDENT Lagrange polynomial evaluated at the same set of share x-coordinates,
// an attacker holding threshold-1 genuine shares can forge one additional share by
// picking any x-coordinate and solving, independently per output byte, for the
// y-value that makes the interpolation land on a chosen byte — including the magic
// bytes AND every KEK byte simultaneously. Embedding a bigger/stronger check INSIDE
// the split payload (e.g. a hash of the KEK next to it) would not help: it is just
// as forgeable, one byte at a time, as the 4-byte magic is. Real protection has to
// come from a value that is NOT itself reconstructed via interpolation — see
// kekCommitment below, verified against a value stored outside the Shamir shares.

// original KEK and must be stored OUTSIDE the Shamir shares (e.g. in the server's
// own config, alongside — not as part of — the share files/env vars). At
// reconstruction time, ShamirKeyProvider recomputes this same commitment over the
// RECONSTRUCTED KEK and compares it (constant-time) against the stored value: an
// attacker who forges a share fully controls the interpolated KEK bytes, but cannot
// make them hash to a commitment they never see and cannot influence, since it isn't
// part of the interpolation at all. The commitment is safe to store in the clear —
// it is one-way and reveals nothing about the KEK — so it can live right next to the

// Package besteffort gives every caller across internal/core, server/http
// and server/grpc one shared way to run a "best-effort, post-commit step" --
// session-limit enforcement, notify fan-out, response enrichment, audit
// emission, dependency events, and the like, where the step's own primary
// write already committed and a failure in the step itself must never turn
// that already-successful operation into a reported failure.
//
// QA-1 (keyorix session reports) found this exact bug shape fixed one call
// site at a time, 12+ times: a function commits a write, then runs a
// non-critical step whose RETURNED error is deliberately discarded (`_ =
// f()`), but a PANIC in that step is NOT recovered, escapes the discard, and
// the caller sees an error (frequently a 500) for an operation that actually
// succeeded. Run and RunRecover below are the one place that panic recovery,
// failure logging and the keyorix_best_effort_failures_total metric live, so
// every call site gets all three instead of re-deriving its own copy (or, as
// happened repeatedly, omitting the panic half of it).
//
// Do NOT use this package for a step that is part of the operation's own
// contract and must fail closed -- e.g. audit-before-disclosure, where a
// secret's value may not be released until its audit write is confirmed
// durable. That must keep failing the operation on error; wrapping it here
// would silently turn a required write into an optional one.

// per-request recovery middleware's log line, with no per-step signal to

// Run executes fn for a best-effort step that follows an already-committed
// write. A panic in fn is recovered; a panic or a returned error is logged
// (never including a secret value -- callers must keep any sensitive detail
// out of the error fn returns, same discipline every audit log line in this
// repo already follows) and counted in keyorix_best_effort_failures_total.
// Neither is returned or otherwise propagated -- Run always returns to the
// caller exactly as if fn had succeeded, because the caller's own result
// already reflects a write that committed before Run was ever called.
//
// Run does not inspect ctx itself (an already-cancelled context does not
// skip fn) -- a best-effort step such as audit emission or notify fan-out is
// expected to still make its attempt even when the inbound request context
// is cancelling, matching every existing best-effort call site this package
// consolidates. A caller whose fn genuinely should skip on cancellation can
// check ctx.Err() inside fn itself.
//
// Run is synchronous: it does not spawn a goroutine, and must not be called
// from inside one that is not already tracked by the caller (use RunRecover
// for a call site that is already running fn in its own detached goroutine,
// e.g. goSafe).

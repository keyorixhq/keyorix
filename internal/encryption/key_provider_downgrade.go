// provider whose strength tier is weaker than an earlier (higher-tier) provider
// in the chain — e.g. a TPM/KMS-backed primary failing over to a
// password-derived fallback. Distinct from the config-time startup refusal
// (NewKeyProviderFromConfig / AllowWeakerFallback): that fires whenever the
// config PERMITS a downgrade; this fires only when the downgrade actually
// happened for this process's own KEK derivation.

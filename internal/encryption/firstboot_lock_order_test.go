// firstboot_lock_order_test.go — regression test for the first-boot
// key-bootstrap race: two processes (simulated here as independent Service
// instances sharing the same fresh key directory) must never both pass the
// unlocked check-then-write in ensureSaltExists/ensureWrappedDEKExists
// (keymanager_lifecycle.go). AcquireExclusiveKeyLock must be acquired BEFORE
// Initialize, not after, so the loser is refused immediately at the lock step
// — before it ever touches salt/dek files — rather than racing key-material
// generation and only surfacing as a corrupted/mismatched key pair on a LATER
// restart ("wrong passphrase or corrupted key file").
//
// TestFirstBootKeyBootstrap_LockBeforeInitialize_ExactlyOneWinner exercises the
// CORRECTED call order directly (AcquireExclusiveKeyLock() then Initialize()).
// Before the fix, AcquireExclusiveKeyLock required the Service to already be
// initialized, which made this order impossible to use at all — every racer
// failed at the lock step with "not initialized", not a lock-contention error,
// and none of the ordering's protection was exercised. That is confirmed
// separately by TestService_AcquireExclusiveKeyLock_BeforeInitialize_Succeeds
// in encryption_s2_test.go.

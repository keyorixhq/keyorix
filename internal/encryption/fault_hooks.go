// fault_hooks.go — a nil-in-production seam for fault-injection testing of the
// durability primitives KEK rotation and DEK rewrap use to persist key material
// (write-pending → rename → fsync).
//
// Distinct from rotation_crash_hooks.go's rotationCheckpoint (which interrupts
// BETWEEN two completed steps, modeling a process crash that skips the rest of the
// function): this hook replaces a chosen step's REAL outcome with an injected
// environment failure — ENOSPC/EIO/short write on the write itself, or an error at
// the rename/fsync call — modeling the disk or filesystem failing WHILE the process
// keeps running and the function's own error-return paths still execute. See
// FuzzFaultInjectedOperations.
//
// In production fileFaultHook is nil and every durableXxx helper below falls
// straight through to the real securefiles/os call, so this adds nothing to the hot
// path and changes no behavior.

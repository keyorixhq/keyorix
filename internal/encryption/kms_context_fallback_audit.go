// who enables the flag and forgets to disable it could easily lose in log noise.

// auditKeyProviderDowngrade — the KEK-manager call chain that reaches here may
// already hold s.mu. Best-effort: a sink write failure is logged but never
// propagated, since the decrypt it's reporting on has already succeeded by the
// time this runs and must not be undone by an audit-logging failure.

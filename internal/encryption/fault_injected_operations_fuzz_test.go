// fault_injected_operations_fuzz_test.go — FuzzFaultInjectedOperations.
//
// Crash-consistency fuzzing (the existing FuzzKEKRotationCrashConsistency /
// FuzzDEKRewrapCrashConsistency / FuzzDEKSweepCrashConsistency trilogy) models a
// process crash BETWEEN two fully-completed durability steps — the write, the
// rename, and the fsync each always run to completion; only the gap between them
// is interrupted. That leaves an uncovered fault class: the ENVIRONMENT failing
// WHILE the process keeps running — ENOSPC/EIO/a short write on the write itself,
// an fsync that reports failure after the data already landed, a SQL statement
// that never executes because the connection/transaction failed. This fuzzer
// targets exactly that class, reusing the trilogy's own recovery-model helpers
// (recoverDEK, recoverRewrap, tryOpen, tryOpenProvider) so the oracle logic for
// "is the DEK still recoverable and uncorrupted" is identical, not reimplemented.
//
// ── Fault model ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One fuzz input drives ONE operation (of six, below) with ONE injected fault at
// ONE seam within it. Every seam in this catalog is called at most once per
// operation invocation, so "the Nth call to seam S" (STEP 2's stated schedule
// shape) is always N=1 here — there is no loop that calls the same seam twice
// within a single operation. This is a narrower scope than a multi-operation
// fault SEQUENCE would be; see the report accompanying this change for why that
// was the deliberate v1 cut. The fault (operation + seam + kind + byte count) is
// fully encoded in the fuzz input, so every failure reproduces from the corpus
// file alone, matching the multi-fault design's own reproducibility property.
//
// Three fault kinds (fileFaultKind, fault_hooks.go) apply to file seams:
//
//	faultCleanError:      zero bytes reach the real file / the rename never runs.
//	faultShortWrite:      the real file gets exactly K of the real bytes, no fsync.
//	faultRealEffectThenError: the real write/rename DOES happen, error reported anyway.
//
// SQL seams use a fourth, GORM-callback-based mechanism (armSQLFault) requiring
// no production code change at all — a Before-hook's AddError stops GORM's
// default Create/Delete callback chain before it issues the real statement,
// exactly as local_pat_expiry_test.go's existing BulkRevokeExpiredPATsByUser
// fault-injection test already does. Every SQL seam here is a "clean" fault
// (the statement either fully runs or does not — no equivalent of a short write
// at the SQL layer).
//
// ── Ambiguity classification (oracle a) ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Directive: faults AT OR AFTER the commit/durability point must accept EITHER
// the pre- or post-change state (never a mix); faults BEFORE it must leave the
// model unchanged. Per seam type:
//
//	write seam, ANY kind          → deterministic OLD. Every write seam here
//	    targets a *.pending file; the function that calls it unconditionally
//	    aborts (returns the error without renaming) on ANY write failure — so a
//	    faultRealEffectThenError on a write seam populates the .pending file
//	    correctly but the ACTIVE file is untouched regardless. Given this, the
//	    fuzz decoder never selects faultRealEffectThenError for a write seam
//	    (see seamSpec.kinds below) — it would be a real capability of
//	    fault_hooks.go's applyWriteFault, just not an interesting one here.
//	rename seam, faultCleanError   → deterministic OLD (the rename never ran).
//	rename seam, faultRealEffectThenError → AMBIGUOUS: durableRename performs
//	    the real os.Rename and only returns the injected error if that real
//	    rename succeeded — so the active file IS the post-rename one, even
//	    though the function reports failure. The oracle accepts either via.
//	sync seam (rewrap:syncdir)    → the preceding rename has, by construction,
//	    ALREADY happened for real by the time this seam fires (durableSyncDir is
//	    only ever reached after a successful durableRename) — so any fault here
//	    is inherently post-commit; the oracle accepts either via but in
//	    practice will always observe the post-rename state.
//	SQL seam                       → deterministic OLD for every seam in this
//	    catalog: GORM's Before-hook AddError stops the INSERT/DELETE from ever
//	    running, and none of the six operations retries or partially commits
//	    around a single faulted statement (the multi-statement DELETE is wrapped
//	    in a real db.Transaction, which GORM rolls back whole on any error).
//
// ── Operations (6 of the original 7-item catalog; PAT deferred) ─────────────
//
// secret create / secret update (version rollover) / secret delete are driven at
// the storage+encryption layer directly (raw GORM model calls + Service.
// EncryptSecretWithAAD), NOT through internal/core — core already imports
// encryption, so encryption importing core to call KeyorixCore.CreateSecret
// would be a cycle. This mirrors the EXISTING FuzzDEKSweepCrashConsistency's own
// seeding code, which already creates secret rows this same way. The call
// sequence and transaction boundaries are copied from the real production code
// they model (internal/core/secrets.go CreateSecret/storeSecretVersion,
// internal/storage/store/local_secrets.go DeleteSecret) — CREATE'S two writes
// (node, then version) are genuinely NOT wrapped in one transaction in
// production (storeSecretVersion is a bare CreateSecretVersion call after a
// separate CreateSecret call), so this harness does not invent a stronger
// atomicity guarantee than production actually has for that operation; DELETE's
// three writes ARE wrapped in one real db.Transaction in production
// (LocalStorage.DeleteSecret), reproduced here identically.
//
// DEK rewrap / KEK rotation reuse the crash-consistency trilogy's own
// standalone-KeyManager harness style and recovery-model helpers directly
// (recoverDEK/recoverRewrap/tryOpen/tryOpenProvider, rewrapDEKFile/
// rewrapSaltOld/rewrapSaltNew) — no new recovery logic, only a new way to reach
// the same crash points (a real fault instead of a real crash).
//
// backup/export models core.ExportComplianceEvidence's file-durability
// primitive — a single securefiles.SecureWriteFileSync to a final path with NO
// separate rename (unlike the DEK/KEK operations) — without invoking
// core.ExportComplianceEvidence itself, for the same import-cycle reason as
// secret CRUD above. The oracle (directive 4) is specific to this no-rename
// shape: after a faulted export, the final path must have either no file, or a
// file byte-identical to the intended content (the ambiguous "it actually
// wrote through despite the reported error" case), or a file that fails to
// parse as JSON (a short/garbled write that would be visibly rejected by any
// consumer) — never a THIRD state: a truncated file that happens to still
// parse.
//
// PAT create/revoke is deferred per the approved scope (no durability path
// beyond the generic SQL layer already covered by secret create/update/delete —
// see the investigation report).
//
// ── After every faulted operation ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The harness runs the REAL production startup/recovery step for that
// operation's family before checking any oracle:
//   - DEK rewrap / KEK rotation: km.CleanPendingDEK() (production's own startup
//     cleanup for a leftover dek.key.pending). KEK rotation's kek.salt.pending
//     hazard window has no automated recovery in production at all — the
//     existing trilogy's own recoverDEK models the documented MANUAL operator
//     step, reused here unchanged, not reinvented.
//   - secret create/update/delete/backup: no key-material recovery applies (no
//     .pending file is involved); the oracle reads storage/disk state directly.
//
// Then oracles (b)-(e) are checked (oracle (a) atomicity is folded into each
// operation's own state check above, per the ambiguity classification).
//
// ── FIXED: kek:rename-dek's ambiguous fault ──────────────────────────────────
//
// kek:rename-dek's faultRealEffectThenError case WAS a confirmed, filed
// data-loss bug (commitNewKEKFiles' error-cleanup deleted kek.salt.pending
// even when the rename it was cleaning up after had actually succeeded) — see
// docs/findings/2026-09-19-FINDING-kek-rotation-rename-dek-cleanup-dataloss.md
// for the reachability conditions (NFS/network-filesystem rename
// retransmission semantics, NOT a directory-fsync error — that WAS, at the
// time of that finding, a separate, disconnected, silently-discarded call in
// the same function; also since fixed — see "kek:syncdir-dek/-salt" below,
// both now checked seams, not a stale claim about current behavior) and the
// fix (dekRenameActuallySucceeded, keymanager_kek_rotation.go): on a
// rename-dek error, verify the actual on-disk DEK content before any
// cleanup; only clean up when the rename provably did not happen. This is
// now DETERMINISTIC, not ambiguous — see expectedKEKVia and
// runKEKRotateFaultCase's transparentRecovery handling. Red-proofed by
// reverting the fix (fuzzer fails again at this exact seam) and restoring it
// (green again); not committed as a permanent toggle.
//
// ── Known limitation: the hang-guard is not yet load-tolerant ───────────────
//
// faultOpGuardDeadline (30s) is a fixed wall-clock deadline, same as the
// crash-consistency trilogy's own per-target deadlines. Under real system
// contention (verified directly: a `-race` fuzz burst hit this deadline once
// on a 10-core/5-user shared machine with a 15-min load average of 10.66;
// re-running the SAME case in isolation immediately after passed in ~5.6s) a
// deadline trip is NOT on its own evidence of a hang in the code under test —
// it currently conflates "the operation is stuck" with "the machine is busy."
// Treat a rig timeout here as inconclusive, not as a finding, until a
// load-tolerant guard (e.g. adaptive to measured baseline latency, or a
// deadline-miss retry-once-in-isolation check) lands — tracked informally as
// "speed-fix-2," not yet a filed issue.
//
// ── B3 encryption-family extension (STEP 3, 2026-09-24) ─────────────────────
//
// Four more operations, covering the remaining B3 (`keyorix-server admin
// encryption ...`) commands that have real production durability seams and no
// existing environment-fault coverage:
//
//   - opInit: KeyManager.Initialize's FIRST-RUN DEK generation
//     (ensureWrappedDEKExists) — a plain SecureWriteFileSync straight to the
//     final path, no pending/rename indirection (unlike rewrap/KEK-rotation).
//     ensureSaltExists's own first-run write is NOT covered: it only runs on
//     deriveKEK's legacy (km.keyProvider == nil) branch, and Service.NewService
//     — the only production constructor of a KeyManager — always calls
//     SetKeyProvider before Initialize, so that branch is unreachable from any
//     live caller (confirmed empirically, not assumed — see opInit's seam-table
//     comment). This op is also `auth-encryption enable`'s entire state-changing
//     effect (AuthEncryption.Initialize thin-wraps Service.Initialize, byte-for-byte
//     the same call), so one op covers both commands.
//   - opUpgradeAAD: Service.UpgradeAuthAAD's per-row Updates() sweep over
//     mfa_secrets/dynamic_secret_configs/dynamic_secret_leases — the same SQL-seam
//     mechanism as opCreate/Update/Delete, extended to GORM's Update callback
//     (armSQLUpdateFault) since UpgradeAuthAAD uses Model().Where().Updates(map),
//     not Create/Delete.
//   - opAuthMigrate: `auth-encryption migrate`'s MigratePasswordResetTokens sweep —
//     the same Update-seam mechanism, one table (password_resets), with its
//     encrypt-then-NULL-the-plaintext-column update.
//   - opMigrateProviderBackup: `migrate-provider`'s OWN unique durability step — the
//     pre-rewrap backup copy (CopyFile) and the restore-on-verification-failure
//     copy (RestoreBackup→CopyFile). The rewrap step in between reuses
//     Service.RewrapDEKWithProvider → KeyManager.RewrapDEK, the IDENTICAL function
//     opRewrap above already exhaustively fault-tests at the write/rename/sync
//     seam level — re-faulting it here would duplicate, not extend, coverage, so
//     this op runs that step for real and targets only the two copy calls unique
//     to migrate-provider.
//
// Oracles for all four (per the STEP 3 approval, deliberately more general than
// the six-op catalog's precise via-path tracking above): after a fault at ANY
// seam, (1) the data is recoverable under the OLD key/provider or the NEW one,
// never neither; (2) re-running the same operation after the fault converges to
// the same end state a clean run would reach; (3) a status/validate-equivalent
// read never reports success on a state that is actually broken; (4) no key
// material or passphrase appears in an error or log line.
//
// Deliberately NOT extended here, with reasons (matching this file's own
// "PAT deferred" precedent rather than a silent gap):
//
//   - `encryption fix-perms`: FixKeyFilePermissions is a per-file os.Chmod loop —
//     no write/rename/sync durability seam exists to fault (a failed chmod leaves
//     the file's CONTENT untouched, only its mode), and a chmod failure is
//     trivially idempotent-safe to retry. No meaningful fault-injection surface.
//   - `migrate-provider cleanup`: securefiles.SecureDeleteFile's shred-then-unlink
//     has no existing test hook, and it is a widely-shared primitive (used well
//     beyond this command) — adding one here for a worst case of "a redundant,
//     already-superseded backup file survives on disk" (not a data-loss or
//     plaintext-exposure risk: the backup is still wrapped, just under the OLD
//     provider) is a disproportionate blast radius for the value. v2 candidate.
//   - `auth-encryption rotate`: AuthEncryption.RotateAuthEncryption delegates to
//     the SAME Service.RotateDEKWithSweep `encryption rotate` uses — already
//     covered by the pre-existing FuzzDEKSweepCrashConsistency (the
//     crash-consistency class, a deliberate different fault model from this
//     file's environment-failure class per the package doc comment above).
//     Extending THIS fuzzer to RotateDEKWithSweep's own multi-table sweep +
//     redo-marker mechanism is real, distinct scope, not a small addition. v2
//     candidate, not silently dropped.
//
// ── v2 candidates (not implemented here) ─────────────────────────────────────
//
//   - Fault during RECOVERY itself: every case above injects one fault into the
//     original operation, then runs the REAL (unfaulted) recovery/startup step.
//     A second fault dimension — the recovery path itself failing (e.g.
//     CleanPendingDEK's os.Remove erroring, or a second crash during a manual
//     apply-pending-salt recovery) — is not modeled.
//   - A Postgres-gated regression test for the abort-after-constraint-violation
//     trap (CLAUDE.md's documented Postgres hazard: a caught violation that
//     returns nil is dead code there) — SQLite-only today; oracle (c)'s
//     fail-closed check is sound against SQLite, not yet demonstrated against
//     real Postgres transaction-abort semantics specifically.
//   - KMS-provider dependency-error/timeout faults for rewrap (rewrap here only
//     exercises the password-provider path). crypto.KMSClient is already an
//     interface with test fakes (internal/crypto/kms_provider_test.go), so this
//     needs no new production seam — just a fault-injecting fake wired through
//     crypto.NewKMSKeyProvider.
//   - The SAME verify-before-cleanup treatment for kek:rename-salt's own
//     ambiguous case (still genuinely ambiguous after this fix — see
//     expectedKEKVia) and, for defense-in-depth, RewrapDEK's rewrap:rename-dek
//     cleanup (not currently exploitable there — no second coupled file — but
//     the same discipline would prevent the bug class re-appearing if that
//     changes).

// keymanager_filelock.go — cross-process exclusive lock guarding the DEK
// read-modify-rename critical sections (#195).
//
// RewrapDEK/RewrapDEKWithProvider (the `keyorix encryption migrate-provider`
// command) and RotateDEKWithSweep (the `keyorix encryption rotate` command)
// both read the currently-active DEK, compute a new wrapped form, and
// atomically rename it onto keys/dek.key. Each is a separate, short-lived CLI
// process with its own KeyManager instance, so KeyManager.mu — an in-process
// sync.RWMutex — provides no protection against the two racing: if an
// operator runs `rotate --confirm` and, concurrently, automation runs
// `migrate-provider --confirm`, the migrate-provider process's Initialize()
// may have unwrapped the DEK *before* rotate replaces it, then win the
// rename race *after* rotate commits — silently overwriting the freshly
// rotated (and now fully re-encrypted-into) DEK with the stale, superseded
// one. Every row in the database, already durably re-encrypted under the new
// DEK, becomes permanently unreadable.
//
// Fix: an flock(2) advisory lock on a dedicated dek.key.lock file, held for
// the duration of each operation's critical section, makes the two mutually
// exclusive across processes. flock locks are owned by the open file
// descriptor and are released automatically by the kernel when the holding
// process exits or the fd is closed — including on crash or kill -9 — so
// there is no stale-lock/PID-liveness bookkeeping to get wrong (unlike a
// lockfile-with-PID pattern; grepping the repo for an existing single-
// instance/PID-lock convention to follow instead turned up none). Advisory
// locking is sufficient here: both operations are privileged, host-level CLI
// commands that already require local filesystem + host access to run.
//
// Mutual exclusion on its own is not quite enough, though: if the SECOND
// operation to acquire the lock is a RewrapDEK that read a since-superseded
// DEK before the lock was even contended for, serializing its write after
// the winner's does not stop it from clobbering the winner's result with
// stale data. RewrapDEK therefore also re-validates, under the lock, that
// the on-disk DEK is still the one it started from (see the staleness check
// in keymanager_rewrap.go) before writing — turning "these two operations
// never run at the same instant" into the actually-required "the DEK on
// disk after both finish matches what's in the database".

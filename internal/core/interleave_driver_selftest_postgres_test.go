// interleave_driver_selftest_postgres_test.go — the driver's own calibration
// against ALREADY-FIXED cross-replica pairs.
//
// "A guard nobody has watched fail is not a guard", and its twin: a driver
// nobody has watched succeed on a known answer proves nothing when it later
// reports success on an unknown one. Every per-issue regression test in this
// campaign rests on one claim about this driver — that it really does pause a
// replica between its check and its write, and really does release the two
// writes in the order asked for. These tests pin that claim to pairs whose
// answer is already known from main:
//
//   - #2648 (UpdateSharePermission vs RevokeShare, fixed by #2666): under
//     EVERY one of the six orderings, a revoke that reported success must
//     stay revoked. The pre-#2666 code failed exactly the A-check,B-check,
//     B-act,A-act ordering; the fix made all six hold. So all six passing
//     here is the positive control, and the driver's own red direction is
//     covered by interleave_production_purity_test.go's planted-violation
//     test plus the per-issue tests that DO go red.
//   - #2660 (AddSecretDependency cross-replica cycle, fixed by #2670): the
//     fix is an advisory lock, so the second replica cannot reach its sync
//     point at all — it blocks on the lock the first replica holds. That is
//     the driver's "Degraded: blocked" path, and this test asserts the driver
//     reports it as such AND still drives both operations to completion with
//     the invariant intact. Without this case a future change that silently
//     turned every blocked run into a pass would go unnoticed.
//
// Postgres only; skipped cleanly when KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN is unset.

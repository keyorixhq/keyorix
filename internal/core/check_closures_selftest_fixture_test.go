// This file exists ONLY to give scripts/check-closures.sh --self-test real,
// stable test names to point calibration ledger rows at, so it can prove its
// pg-gated verification logic actually rejects a bad row and accepts a good
// one — not just the pre-existing "test does not exist" case. None of these
// are, or should ever become, a real closure's proving test: they assert
// nothing about product behavior, only about their own skip/pass shape.
// Never delete or rename one without updating the matching case in
// check-closures.sh's --self-test block.

// TestCheckClosuresSelfTestFixture_AlwaysSkip always skips, unconditionally.
// Used to prove: (1) a default-ci row naming a test that skips is rejected,
// and (2) a pg-gated row is ALSO rejected once KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN is set —
// "gated" stops being an excuse the moment the gate condition the row itself
// claims is actually met.

// postgres_contention_helpers_test.go's pgTestDSN) without actually opening a
// connection, so the self-test stays hermetic and fast in every environment.
// Used to prove a pg-gated row honestly declaring its gate is NOT rejected
// when the DSN genuinely isn't available in this environment — the one
// behavior this whole ledger change exists to add.

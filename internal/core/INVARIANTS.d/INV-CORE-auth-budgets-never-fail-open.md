- **INV-CORE-auth-budgets-never-fail-open** No auth budget fails open on a
  storage error. Every budget goes through the shared limiter in `auth_budget.go`:
  the per-IP `login`, `password_reset` and `sso_begin` budgets (stored in
  `login_attempts`) and the per-account `account_lockout` budget (stored in the
  user row's lockout columns, which bounds password, TOTP, recovery-code,
  step-up and WebAuthn guessing). The stored count is primary. When it cannot be
  read or written, the attempt is counted in that budget's own bounded in-memory
  fallback (same limit and window, `authFallbackMaxKeys` keys, LRU, per process),
  which the check adds to the stored count. `loginLocked` and
  `recheckLoginLockFailClosed` consult the account fallback; a delivered login
  (`clearLoginFailures`) and `UnlockUser` clear it. The fallback has no
  exponential cooldown: an account stays locked while MaxAttempts failures fall
  inside the window. While on the fallback, the in-memory count is held to the
  budget's fallback limit: its limit divided by `fallbackDivisor` (2 for password
  reset) and by `SetAuthRateLimitFallbackReplicas` (config
  `security.auth_rate_limit_fallback.replicas`, default 1), never below 1; a stored
  count that could be read keeps the normal, cluster-wide limit. While the
  password-reset budget is degraded, `RequestPasswordReset` also caps resets per
  account (`passwordResetAccountBudget`, check-and-record atomic), refusing
  silently so the response is unchanged. `AuthRateLimitDegraded` is true while any
  budget fell back within its window and drives `/health`'s `auth_rate_limit`
  field, which names no budget, key or address. Each fallback is audited `auth.rate_limit_error`
  (Success=false; attributed to the account for `account_lockout`) and counted
  in `keyorix_auth_rate_limit_fallback_total{budget}`. The client response is
  unchanged. Why: Andrei, 2026-10-10 18:52 (AUTH-AUDIT-1 item 5). Guard:
  `auth_budget_storage_guard_test.go` (`TestAuthBudgetStorage_OnlyThroughTheSharedLimiter`:
  no login_attempts storage call outside `auth_budget.go` except the relay),
  `account_lockout_storage_fallback_test.go`, `auth_budget_degraded_test.go`
  (half limit, per-account cap, replica divisor, degraded window), and
  `server/http/handlers/auth_budget_routes_guard_test.go`
  (`TestEveryAuthBudget_HoldsWithItsStorageDown`).

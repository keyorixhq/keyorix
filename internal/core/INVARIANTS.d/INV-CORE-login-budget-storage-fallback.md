- **INV-CORE-login-budget-storage-fallback** The per-IP login budget
  (`IsLoginRateLimited` / `RecordFailedLogin` / `ReserveLoginAttempt` /
  `ReleaseLoginAttempt`) neither fails open nor fails closed on a LoginAttempt
  storage error: it falls back to a bounded in-memory per-IP limiter with the same
  `LoginMaxAttempts` / `LoginWindow`, keyed by the same `CanonicalIP`, per process.
  Since item 5 this is the `login` budget of the shared limiter (`auth_budget.go`;
  see INV-CORE-auth-budgets-never-fail-open for the rule that now covers every
  auth budget). Fallback attempts count in addition to stored ones and age out
  with the window; they are never merged into storage. A fallback reservation
  carries `authFallbackIDBit` so a delivered login's release refunds it in memory;
  such an id is per-process and is NEVER persisted to a shared row
  (`sharedLoginSlot`: mfa_challenges / web_authn_sessions `login_attempt_id` get
  nil, so the slot stays counted). A COUNT that fails while writes succeed still
  binds: a successful write made while the budget is degraded is mirrored in
  memory, and a failed count is judged on memory including mirrors (a working
  count ignores them, so nothing is counted twice) (#3032 review).
  Memory is bounded (`authFallbackMaxKeys` keys per budget, LRU; per-key attempts
  capped). Every fallback is audited `auth.rate_limit_error` (Success=false) and
  counted (`keyorix_auth_rate_limit_fallback_total{budget="login"}`); the client
  sees the same 429. Why: Andrei, 2026-10-10 (AUTH-AUDIT-1) — fail-open removed
  the brute-force backstop during any DB fault; fail-closed would lock everyone
  out. Guard: `login_budget_fallback_test.go`
  (`TestLoginBudgetFallback_StorageDownStillEnforcesTheLimit`, `_ADeliveredLoginReturnsItsMemorySlot`,
  `_RecoveredStorageIsAuthoritativeAgain`, `_NoFaultNoChange`, `_IsAuditedAndCounted`,
  `_BoundedUnderManyDistinctIPs`), `auth_budget_review_test.go`
  (`TestAuthBudget_CountOnlyFailureStillBinds`, `_CountOnlyFailure_RecoveryDoesNotDoubleCount`,
  `TestFallbackLoginSlot_IsNeverPersistedToSharedRows`,
  `_ReleaseOnAnotherReplicaRefundsNothingThere`) and
  `server/http/handlers/login_budget_fallback_http_test.go`.

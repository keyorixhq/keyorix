- **INV-CORE-one-time-password-expires-like-wrong-password** Every one-time password the system
  issues (`CreateUserWithOneTimePassword`, recover-admin) is stored with
  `users.one_time_password_expires_at`, written by the same insert / transaction as the password
  hash. `VerifyPasswordCredentials` refuses an expired one only AFTER the bcrypt comparison
  succeeded, with the identical `invalid credentials` error a wrong password gets (no new oracle,
  matched latency), counts it toward the account lockout (`recordFailedLogin`) and audits
  `auth.one_time_password_expired`; the expiry instant itself is refused (`!now.Before`).
  `SetPasswordHash` always clears the expiry, so a password the user chose never expires this way.
  A non-positive configured TTL means the default, never "no expiry". The legacy backfill runs once,
  in the transaction that adds the column. Why: OTP-EXPIRY-1.

// check_then_act_lock_guard_test.go — GUARD-2's Item 4 structural guard: fails
// when a non-test function in internal/core calls a security-check method
// (require*/guard* — this package's own naming convention for an authorizer,
// role, SoD, or admin-count/last-admin decision; confirmed by enumerating
// every existing (*KeyorixCore).require*/guard* method before writing this
// regex, not assumed) followed by a storage/core write in the SAME function,
// with NEITHER call inside the same storage.WithNamedLock acquisition, and is
// not listed in docs/check-then-act-lock-exempt.tsv with a reviewed class and
// reason.
//
// Modeled directly on atomicity_guard_test.go's TestAtomicityGuard_AuditBeforeWrite
// (Session O's O5/O-followup guard) — same shape, same caveats, different
// pattern: that guard asks "does a SUCCESS audit event precede a later
// write?"; this one asks "does a security check precede a later write with no
// shared lock between them?" Both are AST walks with NO control-flow
// awareness: a check on one branch and a write on a mutually exclusive branch
// (an if/else, a switch) is flagged exactly like a true sequential
// check-then-write. A human classifies each hit; this guard only enforces
// that every hit STAYS classified as the code changes.
//
// What this does NOT catch (stated explicitly, per this repo's own
// "ask of any mechanism: what does it silently skip, and does it say so"
// discipline):
//   - A check/write pair serialized by a ROW LOCK (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
//     inside WithTransaction, e.g. login_lockout.go's recordFailedLogin)
//     rather than WithNamedLock: those sites don't call a require*/guard*
//     method at all (the lock IS the check), so they never enter this scan's
//     candidate set in the first place — not a gap in the walk, just outside
//     what a require*/guard*-named call can represent.
//   - A check/write pair where the write is wrapped in WithNamedLock but the
//     CHECK is a free function (not a (*KeyorixCore) method), e.g.
//     machine_identities.go's canTransitionMachine — this scan only matches
//     `c.<name>(...)` selector calls, by construction (mirroring
//     atomicityHits' own c.<Write> matching), so a free-function check is
//     invisible to it. Confirmed by direct grep: canTransitionMachine is the
//     only non-method decision function found during this guard's own
//     construction; if a future one appears, it will silently not be
//     covered — this is a known, stated limitation, not a silent one.
//   - A check and a write that are genuinely on the same WithNamedLock
//     acquisition but reached through two different helper functions this
//     scan doesn't inline (it does not do interprocedural analysis at all).
//   - A write reached only through a `tx` parameter (a storage.Storage
//     transaction handle passed into a WithTransaction closure), rather than
//     `c.storage.<Write>` or `c.<Write>` — this scan only matches those two
//     selector shapes (mirroring atomicityHits' own matching), so
//     `tx.<Write>(...)` is invisible to it. CONFIRMED to matter in practice,
//     not just theoretically: on the pre-fix code this guard's own
//     construction ran against, UpdateSCIMUser's and DeprovisionSCIMUser's
//     real last-admin-guarded writes (scim.go, GUARD-2's inventory finding)
//     all go through `tx`, so this guard did NOT independently flag that
//     gap — it was found by this session's manual inventory sweep
//     (docs/specs/check-then-act-inventory.md) instead, and this guard was
//     only verified against it retroactively. Stated here rather than
//     silently leaving the impression this guard would have caught it.

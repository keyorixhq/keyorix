// dynamic_config_reenable_parent_liveness_test.go — GUARD-5 item 3's only NEW
// finding: SetDynamicSecretConfigEnabled re-enables a dynamic-secret config
// inside a SOFT-DELETED project, with no concurrency involved at all.
//
// # HOW IT WAS FOUND, AND WHY THAT MATTERS
//
// The ordering sweep (cross_replica_ordering_sweep_test.go) runs each
// conflicting pair through all six legal interleavings — INCLUDING the two
// SERIAL ones, where the two operations never overlap. The serial orderings
// are in the sweep as a control group: an invariant that breaks when nothing
// is concurrent is not a race, and reporting it as one sends the fix to the
// wrong layer (a lock, instead of the missing check).
//
// That control group earned its place on the sweep's first complete run.
// DeleteProject followed by SetDynamicSecretConfigEnabled(true) — strictly
// sequential, A to completion, then B to completion — leaves an enabled
// dynamic-secret config under a soft-deleted project. Every other finding in
// that run was a known open issue reproducing under more orderings than its
// report described; this one is a different bug in a neighbouring function,
// and a two-replica fuzzer could have run for a year without separating it
// from #2651, whose race it looks exactly like in the invariant output.
//
// NOT #2651. #2651 is CreateDynamicSecretConfig's second Save racing
// DeleteProject: a stale full-row write putting disabled=false back. This is
// the ENABLE path, used deliberately, serially, by one API call. PR #2675
// (which fixes #2651) leaves SetDynamicSecretConfigEnabled byte-for-byte
// unchanged — checked against its branch, not assumed.
//
// REACHABILITY, traced rather than inferred (CLAUDE.md: "a Go call graph is
// not a deployment path"):
//
//	PATCH /api/v1/dynamic-secrets/configs/{id}/enabled
//	  -> DynamicSecretHandler.SetConfigEnabled (server/http/handlers/dynamic_secrets.go)
//	  -> h.loadConfig  — resolves the config by id; does NOT check project liveness
//	  -> core.SetDynamicSecretConfigEnabled — no project-liveness check either
//
// The handler's own doc comment says this endpoint exists precisely so "an
// admin re-enables one afterward (project restore deliberately does not do so
// on its own)" — i.e. re-enabling after a delete is the intended use. What is
// missing is the ordering constraint: restore the project FIRST. Nothing
// enforces it, and the scoped-permission middleware does not object, because
// the actor's project-scoped role grant survives the project's soft-delete.
//
// SEVERITY, measured rather than assumed. The first draft of this file claimed
// the re-enabled config mints credentials immediately. Running it showed that
// is NOT true: IssueLease has its own project-liveness check
// (internal/storage/store/local_secrets.go resolves the project with
// `deleted_at IS NULL`) and refuses. So the live impact is narrower than it
// first looked, and saying so is the point — an overclaimed severity is how a
// real finding gets dismissed along with its exaggeration.
//
// What the bug actually is: #369's rule is that a project's configs stay
// disabled across a delete AND across a later restore, so that re-enabling
// one is always a fresh, deliberate, audited decision taken while the project
// is live. This path lets the enable decision be taken while the project is
// deleted, where it is invisible in every project-scoped view, and it then
// takes effect silently the instant someone restores the project — with no
// re-authorization at that moment and nothing in the restore's own audit
// trail about a credential-minting config coming back. That is a latent
// privilege-restoration bug (the same shape as #370's "a share silently
// reactivates on restore"), not immediate credential minting.
//
// The end-to-end mint assertion at the bottom is kept anyway, as a
// belt-and-braces guard on that second layer: if IssueLease's project check is
// ever refactored away, this test starts failing on the mint too rather than
// quietly becoming the only thing standing between a deleted project and a
// real credential.
//
// Deliberately SQLite and not Postgres, unlike the rest of this campaign's
// tests: there is no race here, so there is nothing for a second connection
// pool to demonstrate, and a serial bug's regression test belongs in the
// default CI path rather than behind a DSN gate. Modelled on
// catalog_delete_project_test.go's own #369 fixture.

// account_state.go — user account lifecycle state machine (ADR-025).
//
// States:
//
//	active                    — normal; full access.
//	pending_first_login       — provisioned by an admin; must set a password
//	                            before doing anything else (restricted session).
//	password_reset_required   — admin forced a reset; restricted until changed.
//	suspended                 — login is refused entirely (admin security action).
//	deprovisioned             — login is refused; set by SCIM/IdP deactivation. Kept
//	                            distinct from `suspended` so an IdP reactivation clears
//	                            only its own deactivation and can never undo an admin's
//	                            security suspension (incident response wins).
//
// A "restricted" session (pending_first_login / password_reset_required)
// authenticates but the auth middleware blocks every endpoint except the
// password-change / profile allowlist, returning 403 so the client redirects to
// change-password. Completing a password change clears the restriction back to
// active. Admin transitions are audited.

// specifically because it is *not* a lockout: a restricted session still
// authenticates (see AccountLoginBlocked) and self-heals the moment the user next

// AccountLoginBlocked reports whether a state refuses login outright. Both an admin
// suspension and a SCIM/IdP deactivation block login; every login/session/token path
// funnels through here, so a deprovisioned account is refused everywhere a suspended
// one is, with no per-path change.
//
// Fails CLOSED on blank, whitespace-only, and any other unrecognized value — this is
// a change from this function's original design, which deliberately chose fail-OPEN
// here (see git history for the prior reasoning: blocking login outright has no
// self-healing path, so failing closed on a merely malformed value risked permanently
// locking out an already-legitimate user with no recovery short of direct DB/admin
// intervention).
//
// That reasoning was correct in general — it is exactly why AccountRestricted (a
// state that still authenticates but forces a password change) keeps a fail-closed
// default while THIS function, which refuses login outright, did not. But it weighed
// wrongful-lockout and wrongful-access as comparable costs, and at this specific
// call site they are not. For a secrets-management platform: a lockout is
// admin-recoverable in minutes and loudly visible (ReactivateUser, an audited action,
// with the operator informed exactly why via the log line and metric below); an
// authentication bypass through this exact gate is how a suspended/deprovisioned
// account got fully reactivated for login in a real, confirmed incident (a full-row
// storage overwrite silently blanked account_state, which this function's old
// fail-open default then read as "not blocked") — unrecoverable once exploited, and
// may never be detected. At an authentication boundary specifically, the integrity
// argument wins. This does NOT generalize to the rest of the codebase; it is a
// property of this one call site, which is why AccountRestricted's own default is
// untouched.
//
// Four things make failing closed here safe rather than a new blast radius:
//  1. internal/storage/account_state_backfill.go's guardAccountStateValid adds a
//     Postgres CHECK constraint restricting account_state to exactly the ADR-025
//     canonical set — no other value can be newly WRITTEN, on that backend. (This
//     function is still the one enforcement this constraint doesn't reach: it's a
//     pure function over a string, not a query result. A User struct can carry an
//     arbitrary value from a session-cache entry, an API request body deserialized
//     before any write, a test fixture, or a non-Postgres backend the constraint was
//     never applied to at all — SQLite has no equivalent, by design; see that
//     function's doc. The constraint is defense-in-depth for one backend, not a
//     substitute for the check below.)
//  2. TestAccountLoginBlocked_ExhaustsStateRegistry (account_state_exhaustiveness_
//     guard_test.go) statically asserts every AccountXxx constant declared in this
//     file is explicitly listed in this switch's case clauses — adding a new account
//     state without handling it here fails CI, which is what makes "a future state
//     not yet in this switch" (the original comment's main scenario) impossible to
//     ship silently.
//  3. Every existing blank row was backfilled to an explicit "active" before this
//     change shipped (internal/storage/account_state_backfill.go's
//     backfillBlankAccountState, proven idempotent and correct for every blank shape
//     — empty, NULL, whitespace-only — by its own test suite), so this flip does not
//     retroactively lock out any account that was blank for a benign reason.
//  4. The failure is LOUD, never silent: every fail-closed hit below logs the exact
//     value and the affected user ID at security level and increments
//     accountStateUnrecognizedTotal (account_state_metrics.go), so a lockout this
//     causes is immediately diagnosable from a single log line and alertable via the
//     metric — never a mysterious, undiagnosable "why can't I log in".
//
// Release ordering: the backfill (item 3) is backward-compatible — old code reads
// the explicit "active" value exactly the same as it read blank — so it can ship in
// a release ahead of this fail-closed change without any coordination requirement
// beyond "the backfill's release is deployed first". See ADR-025 for the account of
// why a live-database confirmation gate was replaced with these four self-certifiable
// preconditions.

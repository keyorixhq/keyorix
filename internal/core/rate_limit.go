// re-verification sweep, found six weeks after PruneLoginAttemptsProxy's
// sibling CORE-RATE-003 fix in this same file — the "record" endpoint's own
// fields were never given the equivalent scrutiny at the time):
//
//  1. The wire "ip" field was never validated to actually BE an IP, or a
//     known-prefix + IP. A caller holding only system.write could submit the
//     LITERAL string "pwreset:<victim-ip>" or "sso:<victim-ip>" as the whole
//     key, corrupting a DIFFERENT rate limiter's bucket for a victim IP the
//     caller doesn't control — e.g. ten such calls lock that victim out of
//     password-reset or SSO/SAML login initiation, without ever touching the
//     ordinary login limiter at all.
//  2. `at` was accepted completely unbounded. PruneLoginAttempts (this file)
//     can only ever delete rows with `attempted_at < now-LoginWindow` — a
//     caller setting `at` to a far-future value (e.g. year 2099) creates a
//     row NO maintenance sweep can ever become eligible to remove: a
//     PERMANENT, unrecoverable lockout of whatever key it targets, strictly
//     worse than the bounded-window abuse case CORE-RATE-003 closed for prune.
//
// A KNOWN prefix is stripped if present and the remainder is canonicalized
// via CanonicalIP and REQUIRED to parse as a real IP — an unprefixed,
// non-IP key is rejected outright rather than persisted verbatim. `at` in
// the future is REJECTED outright (ErrFutureLoginAttemptTimestamp), not
// silently clamped to now: a relay reports an event that already happened on
// the downstream server's own clock, so a future `at` is either a clock
// skew large enough to be worth surfacing, or a caller deliberately probing
// how far the field is trusted — a silent substitution answers that
// question for them with no signal on this end that anything was rejected,
// and (independent verification session, 2026-08-25) is untestable as a
// rejection: a test asserting "the write succeeded with some clamped value"

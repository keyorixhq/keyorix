// project_membership_definition.go — THE definition of "is a member of project P".
//
// Keyorix has exactly one answer to that question, and this file is it:
//
//	A user is a member of project P iff they hold a LIVE role grant scoped to P
//	(project_id = P, any environment), directly or through a non-deleted group.
//	A global/install-wide grant (project_id = 0) does NOT make anyone a member of
//	any project.
//
// That is ADR-021's two-tier model, and it is the definition authorization already
// enforces: every access decision that asks "is this user affiliated with this
// project" reads it (per-secret ACL eligibility, share-recipient eligibility,
// break-glass affiliation, secret permission resolution), and every project
// notification fan-out addresses it.
//
// # Why this file exists
//
// There used to be a second, non-equivalent notion in the codebase: a row in the
// ADR-022 `project_memberships` table (#2781). Two admin screens contradicted each
// other about the same user because `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/members` answered
// from the role grants while `GET /api/v1/users/{id}/memberships` answered from
// that table — and nothing the web UI does writes the table, so it reported
// "Not a member of any project" for every user on an install whose grants were all
// real.
//
// The two were never equivalent, and the containment runs one way only:
//
//	{active project_memberships rows} ⊆ {project-scoped role grants}
//
// by construction — `POST /projects/{id}/members` (AddProjectMember → AssignUserRole)
// writes a grant and no membership row, while `POST /projects/{id}/memberships`
// (inviteMemberWithMode) and invitation-accept write both. INV-CORE-44 pins that one
// direction and nothing establishes the other.
//
// So `project_memberships` is an ONBOARDING JOURNAL — it records how some grants came
// to exist, and drives ADR-022's 5-state invite machine — not the answer to
// "is X a member of P". It keeps its own reader
// (`GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/memberships`, `TransitionMembership`); what it no longer
// does is answer a membership question. `project_membership_definition_guard_test.go`
// fails the build if a second definition reappears.
//
// # Membership is not the same question as readability
//
// Deliberately NOT in this file: "which projects may this caller READ". That is a
// permission question — `Authorize(secrets.read, Scope{ProjectID: P})` — and its
// answer is a strict SUPERSET of membership, because a global `secrets.read` holder
// can read every project while being a member of none. `GetReadableScopes`
// (authz.go) is that question's single source of truth, and it is what the project
// LISTING uses (#2780). Conflating the two would either hide every project from a
// global admin or hand project data to a non-member; keep them apart.

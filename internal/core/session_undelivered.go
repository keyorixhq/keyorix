// A session-creating write (CreateSession, RotateSession) that reports an error
// may still have committed: a lost acknowledgement, or a commit that landed
// before the driver error. The caller used to treat every such error as "no
// session" and report the login as failed, so a row that DID land was a live
// session nobody held: it showed in the owner's session list, outlived the
// failure until expiry, and a revocation sweep had to find it (#2844, found by
// the exhaustive login-op fault sweep: CreateSession#1/effect-then-error).
//
// The rule these helpers enforce: a login either delivers the session it wrote
// or leaves no usable session behind.
//
//   - The write reported an error: read the row back by its token. Present
//     means the write committed, and the session is delivered exactly as if the
//     write had succeeded (the credential was already verified; the row is the
//     one this call built). Absent means nothing landed, and the error stands.
//   - The write panicked: the row is deleted if it landed, then the panic
//     continues. A panic is a bug, not an ambiguous acknowledgement, so it is
//     never turned into a success.
//
// The token is the key because it is the one thing the caller holds that names
// exactly this row: the ID is unknown when the insert reported failure, and a
// refresh shares its FamilyID with the rest of the lineage. The token was never
// disclosed, so nothing can have cached it.

// EventUndeliveredSessionRevoked records that a session row was found and
// deleted after the write that created it panicked, so its token was never
// handed to the client.

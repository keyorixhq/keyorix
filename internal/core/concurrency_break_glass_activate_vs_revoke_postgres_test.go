// concurrency_break_glass_activate_vs_revoke_postgres_test.go — #2722.
//
// ActivateBreakGlass performs two separate storage operations with no shared
// transaction: it inserts the activation record (state=active), then grants the
// emergency role. RevokeBreakGlassActivationAtomic removes the role and
// transitions the record in one transaction, and deliberately TOLERATES
// ErrRoleNotAssigned ("already gone — proceed to reconcile the record"). So a
// revoke landing between the activation's two writes removed nothing, set the
// record to `revoked`, audited success — and then the activation granted the
// emergency role anyway.
//
// End state: a self-granted, SoD-bypassing role live for its whole TTL, while
// the record every reviewer and the UI reads says revoked. Because the admin's
// revoke reported success, nobody revisits it; ReconcileExpired only touches
// `active` rows so it never cleans it up; and the freed unique-index slot lets
// the user activate a second time.
//
// WHY THE TESTS HERE ARE SHAPED THIS WAY, which is the part worth reading:
//
// Every other fix in this class is proved with the ctaReview beforeA hook — a
// one-shot GORM callback that runs replica B's whole operation immediately
// before replica A's own write. That technique CANNOT be used here, and the
// reason is structural rather than incidental: the fix serializes A and B on a
// named lock, and beforeA runs B SYNCHRONOUSLY INSIDE A's callback, on A's
// goroutine, while A already holds that lock. B would block on the lock
// forever, inside A's own call stack, and the test would hang rather than fail.
// The hook is only usable when A and B contend on database row locks (which the
// DB resolves) and not on an advisory lock held across both.
//
// So the serialization is proved directly instead:
//
//   - TestCTAReview_BreakGlassActivate_WaitsForTheRevokeLock_Postgres holds
//     projectAdminGuardLockKey on replica B — the exact key
//     RevokeBreakGlassActivationAtomic takes — and asserts A's activation does
//     not complete until it is released. That is mutual exclusion with the
//     revoke path, established without needing the revoke itself to be mid-flight.
//   - TestCTAReview_BreakGlassActivate_vs_Revoke_CrossReplicaPostgres races the
//     two operations concurrently, many times, and asserts the INVARIANT on the
//     end state: if the revoke reported success, no live emergency grant may
//     remain. This one is probabilistic by construction, and it is only here
//     because it is red without the lock (see the PR for the measured rate) —
//     it is corroboration, not the primary guard.
//
// The primary guard is neither of those: it is the structural
// TestActivateBreakGlass_InsertAndGrantShareTheRevokeLock in
// break_glass_lock_guard_test.go, which runs in the DSN-less CI leg.

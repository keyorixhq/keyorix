// adr_open_decisions_tripwire_test.go — general mechanism for "an ADR records
// a security-relevant decision, declines to resolve it, and nothing forces
// that resolution to happen." ADR-101 already proves the specific shape works
// (TestCurrentSchemaEpoch_StillOne_SeeADR101, internal/storage/schema_epoch_
// tripwire_test.go) — this generalizes it to an explicit, extensible registry
// rather than one bespoke test per ADR, after a 2026-09-07 review
// (keyorix-private/adversarial-review/ADR-CORPUS-REVIEW-2026-09-07.md,
// Findings 3 and 4) found two more ADRs in exactly this shape with no
// enforcing test at all: ADR-102 (system.write blast radius, Proposed,
// undated) and ADR-084 (admin-bypass structural marker, Accepted but
// deferred, no target date/owner/tripwire).
//
// REDESIGNED 2026-09-07, same day, after the first version's own entry for
// ADR-084 went stale on arrival: it claimed the decision was still "deferred,
// no code changes" when PR #1671 had already implemented it 5 days earlier,
// because the check was purely age-based (elapsed time since openedDate) and
// never asked whether the decision was ACTUALLY still open in code. A
// duration-based check answers "has time passed," never "is the claim still
// true" — those are different questions, and only the second one is what a
// reader actually wants to know.
//
// A registry entry MUST assert the decision's PREMISE — a live, checkable
// fact about current code that would change the moment the decision is
// resolved — whenever one is expressible. ADR-084's premise was directly
// checkable ("does roleSetContainsAdmin still resolve by name") and would
// have caught the staleness immediately, the day #1671 merged, instead of
// sitting wrong in a registry entry that was itself only hours old.
// Age-based expiry is kept ONLY as a fallback for decisions whose
// unresolved state produces no code artifact in either branch — ADR-102's
// (a)/(b) policy choice (alerting vs. permission-scoping) is the current
// example: neither un-chosen branch leaves anything in the codebase for a
// premise function to inspect, so there is nothing to check except elapsed
// time. Do not add an age-only entry without first asking whether a premise
// exists — leave premise nil with a comment stating why not, so the omission
// reads as considered, not overlooked the way ADR-084's was.
//
// When a premise IS expressible, the check still also runs the age fallback
// underneath it (see evaluateOpenDecision) — a resolved premise fires
// immediately regardless of age (catching a stale-in-the-safe-direction
// entry like ADR-084's), and an unresolved premise still ages out on its own
// threshold (catching a decision that's genuinely still open and has simply
// been forgotten). The two checks are complementary, not alternatives.
//
// Each registry entry names: the ADR, a one-line statement of what remains
// undecided, an optional premise function, the date the decision was opened
// (from `git log --follow --diff-filter=A`, not a guess), and a threshold
// duration chosen per-entry with its own stated reasoning — not a single
// global number, since these decisions differ in urgency and don't share a
// natural deadline the way ADR-101's schema-epoch bump does.
//
// When this fires: read the named ADR, make the (a)/(b)-shaped decision it
// declines to make (or confirm it's already been made elsewhere and update
// the ADR's Status), and either remove the entry below or push its
// openedDate/threshold out with a fresh, stated justification for the
// extension — do not just bump the threshold silently.

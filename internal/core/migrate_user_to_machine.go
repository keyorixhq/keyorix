// migrate_user_to_machine.go — operator helper to convert a service-account-shaped
// human user into a project machine identity (ADR-023).
//
// Early deployments often model CI runners, automation, and service accounts as
// ordinary user records. ADR-023 keeps machine identities separate from humans so
// the Members view can segment the two and the machine-token auth path (ADR-030)
// can target them. This helper performs the one-way conversion: it materialises a
// machine identity for the user and (by default) suspends the source account so
// the human-login path is closed. The user is never deleted — suspension is
// reversible and preserves audit/ownership history that may still reference it.

// MigrateUserToMachine converts the user identified by username into an active
// machine identity in projectID. identityType defaults to "service" and name
// defaults to the user's username. When suspendSource is true the source user is
// suspended (login blocked) so it can no longer authenticate as a human. actorID
// is the acting admin, recorded on every audit event. The created machine
// identity is returned.
// actorMachineID is the acting MACHINE identity, or 0 for a human actor —
// #2495, found by actor_kind_literal_completeness_test.go. This path is HTTP-
// reachable (POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/machine-identities/migrate-from-user)
// and the route gate is actor-aware, so a machine identity holding the required
// permissions can perform the migration; passing only actorID recorded
// CreatedByMachineIdentityID as 0 on the resulting identity, leaving a
// machine-created machine identity attributed to nobody. Attribution only — no
// privilege ceiling consults it — which is why this is a lower-severity sibling
// of the bulk-approval defect in the same change, not a second ceiling bypass.

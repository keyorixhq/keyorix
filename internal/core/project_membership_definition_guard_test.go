// project_membership_definition_guard_test.go — #2781's structural guard: the
// repo must have exactly ONE definition of "is a member of project P".
//
// Two non-equivalent definitions existed and two admin screens disagreed about the
// same user (#2781): `GET /projects/{id}/members` answered from the project-scoped
// role grants, while `GET /users/{id}/memberships` and the admin Users list's
// project-count column answered from the ADR-022 onboarding journal — which nothing
// the web UI writes, so they reported "no projects" for every user on an install
// whose members were all real. The fix picked the role grant (ADR-021,
// project_membership_definition.go's header says why) and left the journal as an
// annotation.
//
// A fix is not a guard. These two tests fail the build when a SECOND definition
// reappears:
//
//	TestProjectMembership_OneDefinition_StorageIsProjectMemberHasOneCaller
//	  storage.IsProjectMember — the primitive that answers the membership question —
//	  has exactly one non-test call site repo-wide, core.IsProjectMember. Anything
//	  else asking storage directly is a second definition by construction, because
//	  it bypasses the one place the semantics are documented.
//
//	TestProjectMembership_OneDefinition_JournalReadsAreAllowlisted
//	  the ADR-022 journal's per-user reads (ListUserProjectMemberships,
//	  GetActiveProjectMembership, CountProjectMembershipsByUsers) are called only
//	  from an explicit allowlist. A new call site anywhere else is a new screen
//	  answering "which projects is this user in" from the journal again.
//
// # Recognized call forms, and why this list is complete
//
// Stating this explicitly because an exclusion-by-pattern is only as complete as
// the idioms it knows about, and this repo has been bitten five times by a guard
// that recognized one call shape and missed another (CLAUDE.md's enumeration rule;
// `raw_storage_bypass_guard_test.go`'s `exportedCoreStorageWrappers` was invisible
// to 9 real wrappers for exactly this reason). The walk below matches an
// `*ast.CallExpr` whose callee is:
//
//  1. `*ast.SelectorExpr` with `.Sel.Name == <method>` — covers EVERY receiver
//     spelling without caring what the receiver is: `c.storage.X(...)`,
//     `tx.X(...)` inside a `WithTransaction` closure (the shape that defeated the
//     raw-storage guard), `w.real.X(...)`, `h.coreService.X(...)`,
//     `s.core.X(...)`, `ls.X(...)`, a package-qualified `pkg.X(...)`, and a
//     chained `a.b.c.X(...)`.
//  2. `*ast.Ident` with `Name == <method>` — a bare in-package call, including a
//     method value assigned to a local (`f := c.storage.X; f(...)` still shows up
//     as the selector at the assignment, which form 1 catches).
//
// The one form NEITHER catches is a call through an interface value whose method
// is reached by reflection or a dynamically-built name. Nothing in this repo does
// that to a storage method, and such a call could not type-check against
// storage.Storage without naming the method somewhere these forms would see.
//
// Having found a call, the IsProjectMember guard then has to tell a CORRECT use
// (`c.IsProjectMember(...)` — the single definition, used as intended) from a
// bypass (`c.storage.IsProjectMember(...)`, `tx.IsProjectMember(...)`, ...). It
// does that on the receiver, not on a list of storage-handle names: a call counts
// as correct only when the receiver expression is the single identifier naming the
// enclosing method's receiver AND that receiver's type is KeyorixCore. Every other
// receiver spelling — including ones nobody has thought of yet — is flagged and
// needs an allowlist entry, so the guard's completeness does not depend on
// enumerating the bypass idioms, only on recognizing the one correct one.
// renderReceiver returns "?" for any receiver shape it cannot render, which can
// never equal a receiver identifier, so an unanticipated shape fails closed.
//
// Both tests assert a FLOOR on the number of call sites found before judging any of
// them, so a broken AST walk (wrong root, a directory skipped that shouldn't be)
// fails loudly instead of reporting a vacuous green — the failure mode CLAUDE.md
// calls "a check that always passes".

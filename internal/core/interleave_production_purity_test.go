// interleave_production_purity_test.go — the machine-checked half of
// interleave_sync_points_test.go's central claim: the forced-interleaving
// machinery has ZERO production footprint.
//
// GUARD-5's brief asked for the sync points to live in production functions
// behind a build tag, and for a proof that they compile away ("a test that the
// production binary contains no hook symbols, or the hook is a compile-time
// constant false"). interleave_sync_points_test.go's header explains why the
// sync points live in test-only files instead. That choice makes the proof
// obligation DIFFERENT, not smaller, and this file discharges it:
//
//   - the Go toolchain never compiles a `_test.go` file into a non-test
//     binary. That is a property of the toolchain, not of this repo, and it
//     is strictly stronger than a build tag (which a stray `-tags` in a
//     release pipeline can switch on).
//   - therefore the only way the machinery can reach production is if someone
//     later moves it, or copies a piece of it, into a non-test `.go` file.
//     TestInterleaveSyncPointsAreTestOnly is the check that fails when that
//     happens.
//
// Composed, those two give the same guarantee the brief asked for, and the
// second half is checked on every run in milliseconds rather than by building
// a binary.
//
// Calibration: the scanner is exercised in BOTH directions on every run —
// green against the real repository, and red against a synthetic tree with a
// planted violation (TestInterleaveSyncPointPurityScanDetectsAViolation). A
// guard nobody has watched fail is not a guard (CLAUDE.md), and a guard that
// scans a tree which happens to be clean for unrelated reasons is
// indistinguishable from one whose matcher is broken.
//
// Independently calibrated once by hand against a real binary, recorded here
// so the claim is not purely static: `go build -o <bin> ./server` then
// `go tool nm <bin>` listed 98,917 symbols, of which zero matched
// syncPoint|runInterleav|interleaveOrder|requireForced|guard5. That is a
// one-off sanity check of the toolchain property above, deliberately NOT
// wired into CI: building ./server costs minutes, and a check that only ever
// runs when someone remembers to run it is not a guard — the static scan
// below is the guard, and it covers the only way the property can break.

// secret_readable_listing_truncation_test.go — follow-up item 2: the per-scope union
// bound must be LOUD, not silent.
//
// maxUnionPageSize bounds how many secrets ListReadableSecrets takes from each
// readable scope before merging. Its own comment claimed a pathological scope would
// "be truncated loudly-in-the-logs" — and nothing logged, and the response carried no
// signal, so the merged Total was simply short. That is the same defect class as
// #2780's confidently-wrong zero: a number that is quietly incomplete is worse than
// one that says it is incomplete.
//
// # Why there is an injectable bound
//
// The real bound is 100000. A test that exercised it honestly would seed 100001
// secrets — slow enough that nobody would run it, so the truncation path would stay
// unwatched, which is exactly how it came to be silent. c.unionPageSizeOverride
// lowers the bound for the test instead, so the path is driven at a fixture size that
// costs nothing. The override is unexported, defaults to 0 (= the real bound), and is
// set only here.

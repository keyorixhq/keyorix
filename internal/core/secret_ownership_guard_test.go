// secret_ownership_guard_test.go — structural guard against a third, divergent
// ownership-transfer implementation (the "variant B" mistake called out in this fix's
// history: G10/#1413 added actor authorization to the bulk reassign path but left the
// shared transferOwnership primitive itself unpatched — a partial fix at ONE call site
// instead of the shared check both call sites route through). This test takes the
// opposite structural approach: rather than trusting every future call site to
// remember to re-derive transferOwnership's authorization rules, it parses this
// package's own source and fails the build the moment ANY function other than
// transferOwnership assigns directly to a SecretNode's OwnerID field.
//
// Modeled on internal/storage/store/g81_guard_test.go's AST-freshness sweep: parse
// every non-test .go file in this package, walk each function body, and flag a bare
// `<expr>.OwnerID = ...` assignment whose enclosing function isn't in the allowlist
// below. A fully unexported-boundary refactor (making the field unreachable except
// through one function, a compile-time guarantee) was considered and rejected: GORM
// requires OwnerID to stay exported for column mapping, and dozens of legitimate
// read-only call sites across this package compare secret.OwnerID directly (ownership
// checks, filters, audit payloads) — hiding the field would require touching all of
// them for no safety gain, since reads aren't the risk. An AST sweep on writes alone
// is the smaller, equally load-bearing guard.

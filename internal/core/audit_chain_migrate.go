// audit_chain_migrate.go — one-time re-encoding of the audit hash chain
// (ADR-029) after computeAuditEntryHash's length-prefixed-encoding fix, a
// breaking hash-format change (see local_audit_chain.go's doc comment for
// why the old NUL-delimited encoding was non-injective and had to change).
//
// This is deliberately an operator-triggered maintenance operation, not
// something that runs automatically at startup or on a schedule: rewriting
// every historical row of the one dataset whose entire purpose is tamper
// evidence is exactly the kind of change that should happen with an operator
// watching, during a maintenance window, not silently on the next deploy.

// MigrateAuditChainEncoding re-derives entry_hash/prev_hash for every chained
// audit_events row under the current hash encoding. See
// storage.Storage.MigrateAuditChainEncoding's doc for the full contract,
// including why the caller MUST ensure no other process is concurrently
// writing to this database's audit_events table for the duration of a
// non-dry-run call (stop the server, or run during a maintenance window —
// this call's own transaction only protects against concurrent writes
// through this SAME storage backend's LogAuditEvent path).
//
// dryRun computes and returns the result WITHOUT persisting anything.
//
// On a real (non-dry-run) run: if a retention-anchored row was migrated, the
// anchor is re-signed and persisted under the row's newly computed
// entry_hash (its PrevHash is unchanged — it represents an already-purged
// predecessor that cannot be recomputed under any encoding). A new audit
// event recording the migration is then appended, chained under the new
// encoding — becoming the chain's fresh, self-consistent head.

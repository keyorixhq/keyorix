// besteffort_guard_test.go — internal/core's run of the best-effort-after-commit
// structural guard (GUARD-1; v2 per #2561's coordinator review).
//
// The scanner, its documented blind spots, and its own planted-positive
// calibration all live in internal/besteffortguard. This file is just the
// per-package invocation: scan ".", classify against docs/besteffort-exempt.tsv,
// and assert five things rather than one.
//
// Why five. v1 asserted only "no unclassified hits" and was green in all three
// packages, which established nothing about whether it could ever be red:
// delete the matcher and it stays green forever ("a guard nobody has watched
// fail is not a guard"). Measured afterwards, v1 found 5 hits in this package,
// all of one single callee, behind 12 exemption rows — 7 of which pardoned
// nothing at all.
//
// This package now also has ZERO hits, and the route there matters: the 42
// post-commit discards of writeAuditEventFull/writeAuditEventDiff that #2561's
// bare-call widening surfaced were FIXED (both now recover their own panic),
// not exempted — so their safety is derived from source rather than vouched for
// in a row. docs/besteffort-exempt.tsv consequently has no rows at all, which
// is why the assertions below lean on the scan's preconditions.

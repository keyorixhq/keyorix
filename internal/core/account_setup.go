// account_setup.go — the setup steps a restricted or factor-less account must
// finish before it may do anything else (#3024), and the setup-only session
// that carries an account needing BOTH of them through to a normal MFA login.
//
// Two gates used to wait for each other: a restricted account (ADR-025
// pending_first_login / password_reset_required — a recovered admin, a
// one-time-password user, an admin-forced reset) was confined to
// change-password, and under security.require_mfa (ADR-112) a session without
// a second factor was confined to enrolment, which refused change-password.
// PendingAccountSetupSteps is now the one definition of what is pending; the
// HTTP gate (server/middleware.EnforceAccountSetup) allows the union of the
// pending steps' endpoints, so the two can be done in either order.
//
// A login that needs both steps gets a setup-only session (models.Session.
// SetupOnly): short-lived (SetupSessionTTL, carried through refresh), confined
// to the setup steps, and revoked by EndSetupSessionIfComplete once nothing is
// pending, so it never turns into a full session. The account's next login is
// a normal two-step MFA login.

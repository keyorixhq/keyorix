// interleave_sync_points_test.go — GUARD-5's deterministic two-replica
// interleaving driver.
//
// # WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// GUARD-4's FuzzCrossReplicaInvariants races two replicas blindly: both ops
// are released from one barrier and whichever interleaving the OS scheduler
// happens to produce is the one that gets tested. That found #2650 live, but
// six of its pending seeds (#2646, #2647, #2649, #2655, #2657, #2659) never
// went red in ~400 blind repetitions each, because the window between the
// "check" and the "act" in those functions is a handful of microseconds wide.
// A race test that only fails by luck is not a regression test: it cannot tell
// "the bug is fixed" from "the scheduler was kind this time", and in CI it is
// indistinguishable from a flake.
//
// This file makes the interleaving a parameter instead of an accident. Given
// two conflicting operations A and B, each with one named sync point placed at
// the boundary between its own check and its own decisive write, it can drive
// any of the six legal interleavings of the two (check, act) pairs
// deterministically, every run, with no timing dependence at all.
//
// # WHERE THE SYNC POINTS LIVE, AND WHY NOT IN PRODUCTION CODE
//
// GUARD-5's brief asked for named sync points inside each guarded
// check-then-act function, build-tagged to compile away in production. This
// file deliberately does NOT do that, for one reason that outweighs the
// convenience: the brief also says "never change production behaviour or
// timing", and the strongest available guarantee of that is for the mechanism
// to be physically incapable of entering a production build. A build tag can
// be switched on by a stray `-tags` in a release pipeline; a `_test.go` file
// cannot be compiled into a non-test binary by any invocation of the Go
// toolchain. So the sync points are named for the production boundary they
// represent (see syncPointName below and the per-issue callers), but they are
// IMPLEMENTED as one-shot GORM callbacks on one replica's OWN *gorm.DB
// connection pool — the technique
// concurrency_check_then_act_exempt_review_postgres_test.go (C-GUARD2-EXEMPT-
// REVIEW) and internal/storage/store/concurrency_purge_restore_race_test.go
// already use, generalised here from "run B to completion inside A's hook" to
// "pause either side at its own boundary and resume them in any order".
//
// That choice is not free, and the cost is stated rather than hidden: a sync
// point can only be placed at a SQL statement boundary on that replica's
// connection, so the boundary it marks is "immediately before the first
// <kind> statement this operation issues against <table>" — which is after
// the operation's check and before its write for every function this file is
// used with, but is NOT an arbitrary source-level position. When a function's
// check and act are separated by other statements against the same table,
// this driver cannot pin a point between them; it would need the production
// sync point the brief asked for. No such case arose among #2646-#2660.
// TestInterleaveSyncPointsAreTestOnly keeps the "zero production footprint"
// half of that trade honest.
//
// # WHAT A FORCED INTERLEAVING DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE
//
// Same caveat C-GUARD2-EXEMPT-REVIEW states for its own one-shot hooks, and
// it applies here too: forcing an ordering proves the resulting end state is
// REACHABLE under Postgres READ COMMITTED with no shared lock between the two
// calls. It says nothing about how often an unforced race hits that window.
// Nothing here reaches into either replica's code path — the hook only
// chooses WHEN the other replica runs. Both replicas run their real, complete
// core operations on their own connections, committing on their own.
//
// Postgres only; every caller is gated on KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN like the rest of
// this package's cross-replica tests.

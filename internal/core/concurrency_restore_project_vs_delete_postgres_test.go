// concurrency_restore_project_vs_delete_postgres_test.go — #2723, #2724.
//
// deleteProjectCascade's #2656 project lock was written with GORM's default
// scope, which appends `deleted_at IS NULL`. On an ALREADY-deleted project that
// matched zero rows and locked NOTHING — and that is exactly the case where a
// concurrent RestoreProject has to be excluded. RestoreProject took no lock on
// the project row either; it was locked only by its own final UPDATE, after both
// child UPDATEs had already run.
//
// Every other statement in the cascade is `deleted_at IS NULL`-scoped too, so
// under READ COMMITTED:
//
//	B's cascade locks nothing (project already deleted), its secret and
//	environment sweeps skip (their snapshots see deleted children)
//	A's restore commits — project, environments and secrets all live
//	B's final `UPDATE projects ... WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` takes a FRESH
//	statement snapshot, sees the project live, deletes it, commits
//
// End state: the project is deleted while every restored environment and secret
// is LIVE under it. No serial order produces that (restore-then-delete sweeps the
// children; delete-then-restore is a no-op on the delete side). The consequences
// are #2702/#2710/#2712's: a live secret under a deleted project is reachable
// through global-scope roles, ACLs and the owner short-circuit, is never purged
// (the purge only collects deleted rows), and outlives the project purge.
//
// WHY NOT THE beforeA HOOK, same reason as the break-glass pair: the fix makes
// the two contend on a Postgres ROW lock, and beforeA runs replica B
// synchronously inside replica A's own callback, on A's goroutine, while A's
// transaction holds that lock. B would wait for a transaction that cannot commit
// until B returns, and the test would hang instead of failing. So:
//
//   - TestCTAReview_DeleteProject_WaitsForARestoreHoldingTheProjectRow_Postgres
//     is the deterministic one: replica A holds the project row with the same
//     unscoped FOR UPDATE the fix added, and B's DeleteProject must not complete
//     until it is released. That is the mutual exclusion the fix provides,
//     asserted directly — and it is red before the fix because the old
//     default-scoped lock never contended on a deleted project's row at all.
//
// There is deliberately NO end-state test here, and the reason is worth writing
// down because it looks like an omission. One was written: 14 iterations racing
// RestoreProject against DeleteProject, asserting "never (project deleted AND
// live children)". It was DELETED, because the red proof showed it never
// reproduced the orphan state even with the fix reverted — it failed only on its
// own non-vacuity floor, i.e. it reported that the scenario had not occurred.
// Unsynchronized goroutines do not hit a window this narrow.
//
// Making it deterministic is impossible by construction, not merely hard. The
// interleaving needs A's restore to COMMIT between B's child sweeps and B's final
// project UPDATE, which a one-shot hook on B can arrange — but only before the
// fix. After it, B holds the project row from its first statement, so A's restore
// blocks inside B's callback and the test hangs instead of passing. A hook-driven
// interleaving test can only exist for the broken version of this code.
//
// So the mechanism is asserted instead of the forbidden end state: mutual
// exclusion on the project row (the pg-gated test above) plus the unscoped-lock
// shape on both sides (TestProjectRowLocks_AreUnscoped, default-ci). Shipping an
// end-state test that passes for the wrong reason would have been worse than
// having none — it would read as coverage of exactly the thing it never exercised.

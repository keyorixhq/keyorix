// cross_replica_ordering_sweep_test.go — GUARD-5 item 3: enumerate the hook
// ORDERINGS for every conflicting operation pair the fuzzer knows, rather than
// hoping random timing lands on the bad one.
//
// # WHAT THIS ADDS OVER THE OTHER TWO FILES
//
// cross_replica_forced_interleaving_test.go forces ONE ordering per KNOWN
// issue — the one that issue's own report describes. That is the right shape
// for a regression test and the wrong shape for discovery: it can only ever
// confirm what someone already wrote down. This file inverts it. For each
// conflicting pair it runs all SIX legal interleavings of the two (check, act)
// pairs and reports every one that breaks an invariant, against a registry of
// the orderings already explained by an open issue. Anything outside that
// registry is a finding.
//
// Including the two SERIAL orderings is deliberate and load-bearing: an
// invariant that breaks under "A runs completely, then B runs completely" is
// an ordinary sequential bug, not a race, and reporting it as a race would
// send the fix to the wrong layer. The sweep labels them separately.
//
// # WHY IT IS ENV-GATED AND NOT IN THE DEFAULT CI RUN
//
// 33 pairs x 6 orderings = 198 forced runs, each needing a full world reset,
// plus a multi-second wait on every ordering a correctly-serialized pair makes
// unreachable. That is minutes, not seconds, and its value is DISCOVERY, which
// is a thing you want nightly and on demand — not on every PR, where the
// twelve per-issue regression tests are the right cost/benefit. So it is gated
// on KEYORIX_INTERLEAVE_SWEEP=1 and wired into the nightly rig
// (scripts/fuzzing/nightly-cross-replica.sh).
//
// Being honest about what that costs: an env-gated test contributes nothing to
// an ordinary CI run, which is normally an anti-pattern in this repo ("a guard
// nobody has watched fail is not a guard"). It is not acting as a guard here —
// g5KnownOrderingViolations is the finding ledger, the per-issue tests are the
// guard, and the nightly run is what watches this one. If the nightly stops
// running, this file stops being worth anything, which is why item 4's script
// sends an ntfy line on failure rather than writing to a log nobody reads.
//
// Postgres only; skipped cleanly when KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN is unset.

// --- the conflicting-pair catalog -------------------------------------------

// g5ConflictFamily is one resource whose lifecycle two ops can disagree about:
// a set of DESTRUCTIVE ops (delete/revoke/suspend/disable) and a set of
// CONSTRUCTIVE ops (create/restore/grant/enable/update) over the same
// resource. The sweep crosses the two sets.
//
// COMPLETENESS, STATED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. This catalog is derived from
// g5OpSyncPoints (the ops a sync point can be placed on) grouped by the
// resource whose liveness or state the two ops contend over. It is NOT the
// full 40x40 product, and the three exclusions are deliberate:
//
//   - ops with no sync-point spec (9 of the 40 kinds) cannot be forced at all,
//     so including them would silently degrade to a blind race. They are
//     listed in g5OpsWithoutSyncPoints below and reported by
//     TestOrderingSweep_CatalogCoversEveryForceableOp so the gap stays
//     visible instead of becoming folklore.
//   - pairs from different families (e.g. DeleteSecret against SuspendUser)
//     touch disjoint rows and have nothing to contend over. Including them
//     would multiply the runtime by ~20x for no reachable violation.
//   - destructive-against-destructive and constructive-against-constructive
//     pairs are excluded EXCEPT where both directions genuinely matter
//     (the admin-removal pair 36/37, and the dependency-cycle pair 28/29),
//     which are listed explicitly as their own family.
//
// A reviewer who disagrees with any of those three should add the family here;
// the sweep will then cover it, and this comment is the thing to argue with.

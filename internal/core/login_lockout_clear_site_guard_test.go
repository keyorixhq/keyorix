// login_lockout_clear_site_guard_test.go — the structural half of
// INV-CORE-login-lockout-clear-only-after-delivery (#2894).
//
// The bug this guards against is an ORDERING, not a value: clearing a login's
// failed-attempt counter before some later step of that same login can still
// fail. No value assertion catches it, because the counter ends up correct on
// the happy path either way; it only diverges when a fault is injected into the
// window between the clear and the response. And the window is easy to reopen
// by accident — a new login path, or one new fallible write appended after an
// existing clear, is enough.
//
// So instead of trying to detect the ordering, this test pins the CALL SITES.
// Every place in internal/core that touches the clear, or that re-checks the
// lock without clearing, is listed below with the reason it is safe. Adding a
// call site (or moving one to a different function) fails this test until the
// new site is added to the list with its own justification — which is the point
// at which somebody has to think about what can still fail after it.
//
// It is deliberately a source scan rather than a behavioural test: the
// behavioural half lives in server/http/handlers/login_lockout_no_oracle_test.go,
// where a fault can actually be injected into each window, and it can only ever
// cover the paths someone remembered to write a case for.

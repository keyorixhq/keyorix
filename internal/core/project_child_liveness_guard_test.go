// project_child_liveness_guard_test.go — the default-ci half of #2702, #2710,
// #2711 and #2712, so the fix is guarded in the DSN-less CI leg too (the four
// TestCTAReview_*_vs_DeleteProject_CrossReplicaPostgres tests are the
// behavioural proof and need real Postgres).
//
// It asserts the shape, not the behaviour: each of the four writers must do its
// child write and a project re-check inside ONE transaction. The ordering within
// that transaction — write first, then check — is what makes it sound, and this
// guard deliberately does not try to assert it: an AST walk that claimed to
// verify statement order across a closure boundary would be asserting more than
// it checks. The Postgres tests are what prove the ordering, by failing when the
// check is neutered.

// projectChildWriters is every entry point that creates or revives a row whose
// parent is a project, together with where its project re-check must live.
//
// How this list was derived, rather than asserted: DeleteProject's cascade
// (deleteProjectCascade, internal/storage/store/local_secrets.go) sweeps exactly
// three child tables — secret_nodes, environments, and dynamic_secret_configs
// (disabled, not soft-deleted). So the population is every writer that can make
// a row in one of those three live while the project is being deleted:
//
//   - secret_nodes: core.CreateSecret, core.CreateFolder (both insert), and
//     LocalStorage.RestoreSecret (clears deleted_at). core.RestoreFolder does not
//     exist; folders are restored through RestoreSecret, the same SecretNode row.
//   - environments: core.CreateEnvironment (insert) and
//     LocalStorage.RestoreEnvironment (clears deleted_at — already fixed by
//     #2656 and included here so a regression there is caught by the same guard).
//     seedProjectEnvironment is excluded: it runs inside the transaction that
//     just created the project, so there is no deleted-parent window.
//   - dynamic_secret_configs: the cascade DISABLES rather than deletes, and
//     IssueLease/RenewLease refuse against a disabled config, so a config created
//     in the window is inert rather than live-under-a-dead-parent. Excluded
//     deliberately, not overlooked — if the cascade ever starts soft-deleting
//     them, CreateDynamicSecretConfig belongs on this list.
//
// RestoreProject itself is NOT here: it is the parent, and its own race with a
// re-issued DeleteProject is #2723/#2724, a different shape (the cascade's
// FOR UPDATE matches nothing when the project row is already deleted).

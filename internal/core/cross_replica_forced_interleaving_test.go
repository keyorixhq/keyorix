// cross_replica_forced_interleaving_test.go — GUARD-5 item 2: every one of
// FuzzCrossReplicaInvariants' pending seeds replayed through a FORCED
// interleaving, so each is red-every-run rather than red-if-lucky.
//
// # THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
//
// GUARD-4 recorded twelve pending seeds in testdata/fuzz-pending/<issue>/,
// one per open CTA-parent issue. Six of them (#2646, #2647, #2649, #2655,
// #2657, #2659) never reproduced their issue in ~400 blind repetitions each.
// A seed that does not reproduce is not a regression test — once its fix
// lands, promoting it to the live corpus would add an input that passes
// whether or not the fix is actually there.
//
// Replaying the same seed through interleave_sync_points_test.go's driver
// removes the luck: each row below names the sync point on each replica and
// the ordering that reaches the bad end state, and the driver forces exactly
// that, every run, in about a second.
//
// # TWO ROOT CAUSES, NOT ONE
//
// The narrow check-to-act window is the obvious cause, and the forced
// interleaving is its answer. The second cause was a defect in the fuzzer
// itself, found while building this file and fixed in g4Replica: the replica
// was chosen from the OP KIND (`pick%2`), so both ops of a pair landed on the
// SAME replica whenever their kinds shared parity. Six of the twelve pending
// seeds were affected — #2646 (kinds 0+6), #2649 (0+10), #2650 (0+38),
// #2652 (2+30), #2653 (21+23), #2659 (14+12) — and for those, no amount of
// blind racing could ever have worked, because there was only ever one
// connection pool and one *KeyorixCore involved. TestG4PairAlwaysSpansBothReplicas
// is the machine check that keeps that fixed.
//
// # WHY THESE TESTS RUN IN CI INSTEAD OF BEING SKIPPED
//
// C-GUARD2-EXEMPT-REVIEW's sibling tests are t.Skip'd while their issue is
// open, so they contribute nothing to CI until someone lands a fix. These
// assert in BOTH directions instead, driven by whether the issue still has a
// row in pendingSeedFix (the table
// fuzz_cross_replica_invariants_pending_seeds_test.go already maintains):
//
//   - issue still listed in pendingSeedFix  -> this ordering MUST violate an
//     invariant. The test proves, on every CI run, that the reproduction is
//     deterministic and that the bug still has the shape the issue describes.
//   - issue no longer listed (fix merged, seed promoted) -> this ordering MUST
//     keep every invariant. The test is now an ordinary regression test.
//
// So there is exactly one place to update when a fix lands — the same
// pendingSeedFix row the promotion gate already requires you to delete — and
// the transition is loud in both directions: forget to delete the row and
// this test fails saying the bug appears fixed; delete it without the fix
// actually landing and it fails saying the bug is still reproducible.
//
// This is deliberately an assertion that a bug EXISTS, which is unusual.
// It is justified here because the alternative (t.Skip) provides no signal at
// all, and because the thing being pinned is not the bug but the
// REPRODUCTION: the entire premise of promoting these seeds later is that
// they reproduce, and that premise is exactly what six of twelve seeds failed
// to satisfy. "A test whose premise turns out to be untested is a coverage
// gap" (CLAUDE.md) — this tests the premise.
//
// Postgres only; skipped cleanly when KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN is unset.

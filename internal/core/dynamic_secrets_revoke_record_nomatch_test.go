// dynamic_secrets_revoke_record_nomatch_test.go — #2836 review follow-up.
//
// #2698 converted RevokeLease's two full-row lease Saves to the column-scoped
// RecordDynamicSecretLeaseRevocation, which returns (matched, error). Both call
// sites then ignored `matched`: the revoke-failed branch discarded the whole
// result with `_, _ =`, and the success branch checked only the error. A
// zero-row UPDATE therefore read, at both sites, exactly like a successful one.
//
// Why that matters on the success path specifically: the target credential is
// already dropped by then, so this is a bookkeeping hole rather than a live
// credential — but RevokeLeasesForConfig and the REST/gRPC bulk-revoke handlers
// both turn a nil return into an unconditional success report. A success nothing
// in storage corroborates is the same defect #2406's !auditOK branch exists to
// prevent, two lines further down the same function.
//
// The no-match is produced by actually DELETING the lease row — not by a stub
// returning (false, nil) — so the UPDATE really does affect zero rows, against
// the real storage, through the real method. The deletion happens inside the
// decorator, on the call immediately before the one under test, which is the
// interleaving a concurrent lease purge produces.

// NamedLockFamily is one family of WithNamedLock keys: every key built by one

// different IDs, but only acquired in ascending ID order.

	Exact       bool
	Nestable    bool
	Constructor string // where the key is built, for the error message
	// PendingPR names the open PR that introduces this family's constructor,

	// is fixed before the nesting lands). Delete it once that PR merges;
	// TestNamedLockOrder_EveryCallSiteKeyHasAFamily fails on any PendingPR
	// after NamedLockPendingExpires.

// NamedLockOrder is the ONE declared acquisition order for every
// storage.WithNamedLock key family (C-GUARD-3 guard 3), outermost first. A
// call chain that already holds a key of family i may only acquire a key of
// family j > i, or (Nestable only) a key of the same family with a larger ID.
// Any two call chains that respect one total order cannot deadlock on these
// locks against each other — on Postgres, pg_advisory_lock waits forever, so a
// cycle here is a permanent hang of both replicas' requests, not a timeout.
//
// How the order was established (2026-10-04): every WithNamedLock call site in
// internal/core and internal/storage/store was enumerated (`grep -rn
// 'WithNamedLock(' --include=*.go`), giving the 9 constructors below; the
// whole internal/core test suite was then run with every nested acquisition
// logged. The observed nestings were
//
//	dual-control-approval -> sod-grant:user     (approve a role request)
//	project-membership    -> sod-grant:user     (membership activate grants a role)
//	last-admin-guard      -> project-admin-guard (group delete/removal)
//	project-admin-guard   -> project-admin-guard (ascending, lockProjectAdminGuardsInOrder)
//	project-admin-guard   -> sod-grant:user     (SetProjectMemberRole -> AssignUserRole)
//	sod-grant:group       -> sod-grant:user     (withGroupMemberSoDLocks)
//
// which form no cycle; the table is a total order consistent with all of them.
// Families with no observed nesting are placed by their role (coarse
// admin-count guards before per-principal grant locks; graph/environment
// locks last, they are taken around a single storage write).
//
// If the checker reports an inversion, that is a real potential deadlock in
// the code: fix the acquisition order (or file it), do NOT reorder this table
// to make the inversion legal — a reorder that makes one chain legal makes the
// chain it deadlocks with illegal, which the next run then reports.
//
// Not covered: locks other than WithNamedLock (in-process sync.Mutex fields
// such as globalAdminGuardMu, accountStateMu and secretDependencyMu; row
// locks; WithBootstrapLock/WithAuditCheckpointLock), and any call chain that
// no test drives — the runtime checker is dynamic, it sees only nestings that
// actually execute. (The static half, TestNamedLockOrder_EveryCallSiteKeyHasAFamily
// in internal/core, checks only that every key has a family, not nesting.)

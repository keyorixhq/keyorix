// concurrency_restoregroup_admin_grant_toctou_postgres_test.go — the
// CROSS-REPLICA Postgres counterpart to
// concurrency_restoregroup_admin_grant_toctou_test.go (package core_test),
// which is #2455's existing deterministic regression.
//
// Why this file exists, stated plainly: the SQLite test hands goroutine A and
// goroutine B the SAME storage.Storage instance. On a non-Postgres dialect
// WithNamedLock serializes through that one LocalStorage's own in-process
// namedLockRegistry mutex (local_named_lock.go), so that test cannot
// distinguish "RestoreGroup's read+check+write section is serialized against a
// concurrent grant" from "both callers happened to share one process-local
// mutex." It is a correct regression for the single-process shape and proves
// nothing about the HA shape ADR-039 ships: two replicas, two processes, two
// connection pools, where pg_advisory_lock is the only thing that can still
// serialize them. A fix that silently lost its Postgres branch would leave
// that test green.
//
// This test closes that gap. Each simulated replica gets its OWN *gorm.DB into
// the SAME isolated schema (own LocalStorage, own namedLockRegistry, own
// KeyorixCore), so the in-process mutex is structurally incapable of
// serializing them — only the advisory lock can.
//
// The interleaving is forced, not statistical:
//
//  1. Replica A calls RestoreGroup for a non-global-admin actor. Its real,
//     unmodified GetGroupRoles read runs (role set empty) and
//     requireGlobalAdminToReinstateAdminRoles passes trivially. A then blocks,
//     via a thin storage decorator, immediately before its own storage-level
//     RestoreGroup write — still inside WithNamedLock, still holding
//     sodGrantLockKey("group", id).
//  2. Once A is confirmed blocked there, replica B — a genuinely separate
//     connection — calls the real AssignGroupRoleWithExpiry to grant the group
//     an admin-tier role. That is exactly the call whose storage-level write
//     (assignGroupRole, local_rbac.go) never checks the target group's
//     existence or soft-delete state, so it lands on a soft-deleted group
//     happily.
//  3. B is given a generous bounded window to finish BEFORE A is released.
//     Without a cross-connection lock, nothing blocks B and that window is
//     always enough. With it, B is parked on pg_advisory_lock inside Postgres
//     and the window always elapses.
//
// Skipped (not failed) without KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN: pg-gated, per
// docs/security-closures.tsv's verification column convention.
//
// package core (not core_test) for the unexported pgTestDSN /
// pgIsolatedSchemaDSN / pgOpen helpers in postgres_contention_helpers_test.go,
// the same reason concurrency_2352_lastadmin_guard_sweep_postgres_test.go is.

// webauthn_clone_audit_unconditional_test.go — #2836, a review finding against
// #2700's own fix earlier in this same branch (never on main).
//
// #2700 replaced markWebAuthnCredentialClonedDisabled's full-row GORM Save with
// a column-scoped conditional UPDATE, because the Save's 0-rows fallback
// re-INSERTED a passkey the user had concurrently deleted. Correct, and it
// introduced a regression: the new code returned early when the UPDATE matched
// no rows, and when it failed outright, in both cases BEFORE the
// EventWebAuthnCloneDetected audit write. The Save it replaced always reached
// that write (it upserted the row back), so a clone signal that previously left
// an audit trail now left nothing at all whenever the credential vanished — or
// the database hiccuped — in the window between the assertion check and the
// disable.
//
// The regression was additionally covered by a comment asserting that
// "the caller's rejectIfCloned path already audits the clone signal separately
// for the credential-missing case". It does not: rejectIfCloned's else branch
// fires only when the LOOKUP fails, never when a lookup succeeds and the
// following UPDATE matches nothing. That cover was asserted, never checked. The
// tests here are the check.
//
// Both subtests assert the EFFECT — an audit row that exists, with a detail
// that says what actually happened to the credential — not a return value.
// They have to: the failure mode is silence, and markWebAuthnCredentialClonedDisabled's
// error return is DISCARDED by its only login-time caller, so no return value
// anywhere in the chain distinguishes "audited" from "silently skipped".

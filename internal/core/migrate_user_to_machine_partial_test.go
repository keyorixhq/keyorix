// migrate_user_to_machine_partial_test.go — #2867: MigrateUserToMachine's
// identity insert and its source-user suspension commit together, and every
// check that can refuse the operation runs BEFORE either write.
//
// Why this exists. The function used to create the machine identity in its own
// transaction and then suspend the user in a second one, reporting the partial
// state in its error when the suspension failed. That left a brand-new machine
// identity beside a still-ACTIVE human account with live sessions and PATs —
// and crucially, the two refusals that reach that path are reachable on
// ORDINARY input, not just under injected faults:
//   - an actor who does not outrank the target (setAccountState's admin-rank
//     ceiling), and
//   - a target who is the install's last global admin (guardLastAdminDeactivation).
//
// Both are now hoisted ahead of any write, and the two writes share one
// transaction, so each of the tests below asserts the same invariant from a
// different angle: NOTHING is committed unless EVERYTHING is.
//
// All of them run against a REAL SQLite store rather than MockStorage, for two
// reasons. A mock's WithTransaction runs its closure inline and commits nothing,
// so it cannot demonstrate a rollback at all — asserting rollback against one
// would be a test whose fixture structurally cannot exercise what its name
// claims. And both refusal paths fan out across roles, permissions, groups and
// group-role grants; stubbing each lookup is brittle and proves less than
// seeding two real admin grants.
//
// Each refusal test asserts its FIXTURE PRECONDITION first — that the guard
// under test really does refuse this target, and that the OTHER guard really
// does pass. Without that, "the migration was refused" says nothing about WHICH
// check refused it, and both tests would have passed for the wrong reason: while
// writing them, the preconditions caught a seeded role that was not actually an
// admin role (admin-ness is Role.BypassesPermissionChecks, ADR-084, not the
// name) and an AutoMigrate list short enough that the guards were failing closed
// on a missing table instead of refusing.
//
// A happy-path test sits alongside them on the same fixture: without it, three
// "nothing was committed" assertions would be satisfied by a function that never
// works.

// concurrency_credential_under_suspend_sqlite_test.go — #2701 on SQLite.
//
// The SQLite counterpart of concurrency_credential_under_suspend_postgres_test.go:
// the same two-replica ctaReview fixture, built on ONE SQLite file opened by
// three independent *gorm.DB pools with the PRODUCTION pragmas (see
// sqliteProdPragmas), so it runs in default CI rather than only where a
// Postgres DSN exists.
//
// What differs from Postgres, and why the hook below is not beforeA: production
// SQLite opens every transaction with BEGIN IMMEDIATE (_txlock=immediate), which
// takes the database's single write lock at BEGIN. Before the fix, the
// credential INSERT ran in autocommit with no lock held, so replica B's whole
// sweep could run and commit in the window before it — exactly the interleaving
// #2701 describes, and the one this test forces. After the fix the INSERT runs
// inside a transaction that already holds the write lock, so on SQLite B
// physically cannot run in that window: the earliest point it can run is after
// A commits. Running B synchronously there (as beforeA does) would not choose an
// interleaving, it would deadlock B against A for the busy timeout. So the hook
// runs B at the earliest point the engine permits — in the window when A holds
// no transaction, otherwise straight after A returns — and the assertion is the
// one that must hold in EVERY legal interleaving: no live credential survives a
// sweep that reported success.
//
// The opposite ordering — B's sweep committed entirely before A's insert
// transaction even begins, which is what the owner re-check
// (requireLiveCredentialOwner) exists for — is pinned deterministically, with no
// concurrency at all, by TestCredentialInsertRefusedForUnusableOwner
// (internal/storage/store).

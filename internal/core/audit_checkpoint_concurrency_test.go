// writes deadlocking on lock-upgrade under deferred mode); it cannot mask a

// TestConcurrency_AuditCheckpoint_NoOutOfOrderChain drives many goroutines, each

// WriteAuditCheckpoint's chain-walk (VerifyAuditChain) + read-latest-checkpoint +
// decide + create-checkpoint sequence has no transaction, row lock, or advisory
// lock, so two overlapping calls can interleave and commit a checkpoint out of
// chain-length order — the row with the higher DB id certifying FEWER chained
// events than an earlier-committed row. That silently reopens the exact
// tail-truncation-detection gap ADR-029 exists to close: LatestAuditCheckpoint's
// `id DESC` pick would be a checkpoint that never actually certified an event
// that landed in the interleaving window.
//
// With WithAuditCheckpointLock serializing the whole sequence, every checkpoint
// commit is strictly ordered against every other: this test asserts that

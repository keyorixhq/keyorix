// TestConcurrency_LoginRateLimit_TripsAndStaysTripped drives the real per-IP brute-force
// path — RecordFailedLogin → IsLoginRateLimited (ADR-040) — from many concurrent attempts
// and asserts the end-to-end invariant: once the failed-attempt budget is reached, the IP
// is rate-limited and stays that way, with every attempt counted. The limiter is a
// fail-open backstop (the check is intentionally separate from the record, so it does NOT
// promise "at most N attempts ever pass" under a race) — the guarantee it MUST keep is
// that concurrent attempts can't deflate the count and slip the IP back under budget.

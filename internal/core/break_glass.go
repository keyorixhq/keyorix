// local_named_lock.go): that hazard is specifically about a NESTED
// WithNamedLock call needing a SECOND connection from the pool while the

// — unbounded with nesting depth. WithTransaction is never itself a
// WithNamedLock call and takes no named lock inside; it needs at most one
// additional connection, the same single extra connection any ordinary
// storage call already needs when run inside a WithNamedLock closure (see
// the guard's own GetUserRoleIDsExact call two lines below, or
// RemoveUserRole/SetProjectMemberRole/RemoveProjectMember's identical

// ReviewBreakGlass records a post-activation review (ADR-112 §3, break-glass
// review item 5): who reviewed it, when, and why. Activation itself stays
// single-person (decided) -- this is a SEPARATE, after-the-fact check, not a
// second approver gating the grant. actorID is the reviewer; projectID scopes
// and double-checks the activation the same way RevokeBreakGlass does.
//
// Three refusals, all added in #2461's coordinator review, each of which the
// control is worthless without:
//
//   - An UNATTRIBUTABLE reviewer (actorID==0: a machine identity, which
//     authenticates with UserID==0 and authorizes via PrincipalID, or an
//     unauthenticated local-CLI invocation) is refused via the same
//     requireHumanReviewer access-review decisions already use. A review whose
//     reviewer is nobody records accountability to nobody.
//   - SELF-review is refused. This is the load-bearing one: ADR-112 keeps
//     activation single-person *because* an independent after-the-fact review
//     follows it ("Break-glass remains single-person, with mandatory alert,
//     audit event and post-activation review"). Letting the activator close
//     out their own activation collapses the two-person property the whole
//     design rests on into one person. There is no co-approver to also
//     exclude: BreakGlassActivation carries no approver field and ADR-112
//     explicitly rejects two-person break-glass ("an emergency path that needs
//     a second person fails exactly when it's needed"), so the actor and the
//     activating user are the only two identities an activation has.
//     TestBreakGlassActivation_HasNoApproverField guards that premise rather
//     than this conclusion, so adding co-approval later forces this exclusion
//     to be revisited instead of silently leaving a second self-review path.
//   - A STILL-ACTIVE activation is refused; it must be revoked or expired
//     first. A reviewer cannot assess what was done with access that is still
//     in use, and a recorded review of an unfinished event reads, to an
//     auditor and to the posture report alike, as a closed item. Note State is
//     a read-time projection (GetBreakGlassActivation), so a TTL-lapsed
//     activation reads "expired" here without needing a write first.
//
// Refusing a review while active does NOT weaken the posture deviation: an
// unreviewed activation past the review window is reported either way (see
// accumulateBreakGlassPosture), which is exactly ADR-112's "an open activation
// without a recorded review shows as a posture deviation."

//
// What "enforced" means here is exactly what ADR-112 says and nothing more.
// The ADR's words are "every activation must be reviewed afterwards: an open
// activation without a recorded review shows as a POSTURE DEVIATION", and
// separately "Break-glass remains single-person, with mandatory alert, audit
// event and post-activation review. Two-person break-glass is rejected: an
// emergency path that needs a second person fails exactly when it's needed."
// So the enforcement is visibility -- the posture report (item 4), this
// recurring warning, and a permanent audit event -- NOT a lockout. Nothing
// here blocks an activation, blocks a user, or expires a grant early, and no
// such lockout should be added without an explicit product decision: an
// emergency path that can be disabled by an un-filed piece of paperwork fails
// exactly when it is needed, which is the failure mode the ADR already
// rejected for two-person approval.
//
// Emits ONE audit event per pass when the count is non-zero, not one per
// activation: the per-activation detail is already in the posture report and
// in each activation's own break_glass.activated event, and a per-row event
// would make a long-ignored review spam the audit log it is supposed to make
// legible. A pass that finds nothing writes nothing.

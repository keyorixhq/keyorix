// audit_target.go — writing audit events through an explicit storage handle
// (#2676).
//
// Every audit writer in this package funnels through emitAudit, which writes via
// c.storage and then runs the event's off-box side effects (SIEM forward, waking
// live audit tails). That is correct for the overwhelming majority of callers:
// their primary operation has already committed, and the audit row is the last
// thing to happen.
//
// It is not sufficient for a caller whose primary operation and audit row must
// land or roll back TOGETHER — DecideAccessReviewItem's revoke path, where an
// `access_review.revoked` row recording a revocation that did not happen is
// false compliance evidence (see access_review_decide_tx.go). Such a caller
// needs two things emitAudit cannot give it:
//
//  1. the write to go through the TRANSACTION-scoped storage handle, not
//     c.storage, so it participates in the same commit/rollback; and
//  2. the off-box side effects to be HELD BACK until that transaction commits.
//     emitAudit's own doc comment already states the principle this preserves:
//     "do NOT forward a phantom event ... the off-box mirror must reflect the
//     durable chain, not events that never landed." An event forwarded from
//     inside a transaction that then rolls back is exactly such a phantom.
//
// auditTarget carries both. The existing writers are unchanged for every
// existing caller: each keeps its signature and delegates to an `On` variant
// with c.auditNow(), so there is ONE body per writer, not a transaction-aware
// copy of each. (A duplicated set would be the same "second,
// separately-maintained implementation" shape #2496 had to unwind.)

//
// Best-effort is preserved for the transactional case too: a failed audit write

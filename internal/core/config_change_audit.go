// config_change_audit.go — shared audit-emitting helper for admin-only
// (system.write-gated) singleton/registry configuration mutations.
//
// Two independent call sites shared the same audit-trail gap: notification
// channel CRUD (notification_channels.go) and the anomaly detection config
// (anomaly_config.go) both let a system.write holder mutate the config with
// zero audit_events record. The combined threat shape is identical in both
// cases: an admin can silently redirect/disable the detection-and-alerting
// layer, act while it's blind, then restore prior state -- leaving no
// permanent record of the intervening window. Rather than adding two
// independent writeAuditEvent calls (which the next similar config surface
// would just re-duplicate), both route through this ONE helper, matching the
// writeRBACAudit precedent in audit.go (a domain-specific wrapper over the
// generic writeAuditEventDiff writer). config_change_audit_guard_test.go
// statically asserts both call sites actually reach it.

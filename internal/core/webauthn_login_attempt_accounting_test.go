// TestFinishWebAuthnLogin_MintFailureAfterAssertion_StillCountsTheLoginAttempt
// is the proving test issue #2880 asks for, for the CreateSession half of its
// pair.
//
// #2880 is an attempt-ACCOUNTING question, not an atomicity one: when a storage
// fault lands AFTER the WebAuthn assertion has been evaluated and passed, does
// the request still consume one of the IP's login-attempt slots? The oracle (a)
// finding that raised it is `op="REST POST /auth/webauthn/login/finish"`,
// `nth=1`, `kind=error`, diff `[LoginAttempt]`, on two methods:
//
//	GetUserRoles  -> 500, diff [LoginAttempt]
//	CreateSession -> 401, diff [LoginAttempt]
//
// The answer is YES, it stays counted, and that is INTENDED (#2880, auth
// owner's decision): a request whose credential was genuinely evaluated is a
// login attempt whatever happened afterwards. Releasing the slot for it would
// let an attacker drive unlimited post-verification failures against an IP
// without ever spending budget — the handler states exactly that rule
// ("An invalid/expired challenge or session, or a failed assertion, stays
// counted", server/http/handlers/webauthn.go).
//
// #2880's own text is explicit that the GetUserRoles row already had a proving
// test and the CreateSession row did NOT — and that citing
// TestFinishWebAuthnLogin_MintFailureAfterConsume_FailsClosed for it would be
// citing a test that does not prove the claim: that test proves fail-closed
// (no session issued, both single-use values stay consumed) and asserts
// nothing whatsoever about attempt accounting. This is the missing half.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED, and why that is the whole claim: the handler releases the
// reservation on exactly one condition — errors.Is(err,
// ErrWebAuthnLoginNotEvaluated) — and on no other. So "the slot stays counted"
// is, precisely, "the returned error does not wrap that sentinel". A mutation
// that made mintSession's failure wrap ErrWebAuthnLoginNotEvaluated (the
// plausible wrong fix: treating any storage error on this op as
// not-evaluated) turns this red, and is the exact change that would hand an
// attacker the free-retry budget.
//
// This is deliberately the core-level assertion rather than an end-to-end row
// count: the effect itself is already driven end-to-end by
// FuzzStorageFaultOperations on this very op (that is how the finding was
// found), and only internal/core has a fixture that can produce an assertion
// which actually VERIFIES — the handler package's WebAuthn fixtures use a
// cryptographically meaningless credential that never reaches a passed
// assertion, so a handler-level test could not get past the verdict at all.

// leave the test above green while silently making every pre-verdict storage

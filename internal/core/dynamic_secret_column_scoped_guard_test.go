// TestUpdateDynamicSecretLease_HasNoProductionCaller is the half that does NOT
// depend on anyone remembering to update a per-function guard.
//
// #2698 could not DELETE the two full-row primitives the way #2696 and #2697
// deleted theirs: `UpdateDynamicSecretConfig` still has one production caller,
// CreateDynamicSecretConfig's encrypted-DSN write, and that call site belongs to
// #2651 — fixed in open PR #2675 with SetDynamicSecretConfigAdminDSN, in the same
// few lines of local_dynamic.go and interface.go. Deleting the method here would
// have made this PR conflict with one the coordinator is about to merge, for no
// safety gain.
//
// So the property is enforced by derivation instead of by removal, which is the
// stronger form anyway: a sweep over every non-test file under internal/core and
// server/ asserting that NOTHING calls the full-row lease writer. UpdateDynamicSecretConfig
// is asserted down to its ONE known remaining caller, named explicitly, so the
// count going UP fails here and #2675 landing lets the allowance drop to zero
// (at which point both methods can simply be deleted).
//
// What this does not cover: a call reached through a helper that itself takes a
// storage.Storage, or reflection. Both are absent from this repo's storage call
// style, and this test's own job is the direct-call shape the defect took.

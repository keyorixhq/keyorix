// actor_sentinel_completeness_test.go — P3's chosen fix for the actorID==0
// sentinel ambiguity (#1524, #1532): NOT a Principal type migration (rejected
// as defence in depth behind an existing control, at 20-100x the cost -- P2's
// node-credential route classification already closes this class at the
// boundary where it actually bites: a machine actor can only reach a
// per-actor ceiling through a machine-credential-authenticated route, and
// server/http/node_credential_route_classification_test.go now classifies
// and enforces every one of those). Instead: a frozen, exhaustive inventory
// of every `actorID == 0` / `actorID != 0` comparison in this package,
// classified as classPerActorCeiling (an authorization decision) or
// classAuditOnly (attribution metadata, no authorization implication), with
// a completeness test that fails the moment a FIFTH such comparison appears
// anywhere in this package outside this list -- forcing the same
// enforced/open-gap classification this file already did for the first
// four, at authoring time, not at the next audit round. Same shape as
// remote_unsupported_completeness_test.go's allowlist (C5's pattern).
//
// Keyed by "<file>:<enclosing func>", not file:line -- a line-numbered key
// would need updating on every unrelated edit above the comparison; a
// (file, func) key survives that churn. The trade-off: a SECOND actorID==0
// comparison added to an ALREADY-listed function collapses into the same
// key and isn't separately flagged. Accepted -- the dangerous case this
// guards against is a new function introducing the pattern, not a second
// comparison inside a function a reviewer is already touching (and which
// this table's note already flags).

// field, and the acting reviewer plus the activating user are the only two
// identities an activation has -- which is exactly what the actorID ==
// activation.UserID check covers in full.
//
// A guard aimed at the conclusion ("no co-approver can review") would be
// vacuous today: the population it checks is empty precisely because the

// later fails HERE and forces the co-approver exclusion to be written, rather

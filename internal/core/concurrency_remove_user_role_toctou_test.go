// concurrency_remove_user_role_toctou_test.go — TOCTOU-1: rbac_management.go's
// RemoveUserRole (project-scope branch) originally acquired projectAdminGuardLockKey
// only around the guard's READ and DECIDE, releasing it BEFORE calling
// removeUserRoleUnguarded -- so the lock never actually serialized the
// read-then-write sequence, only the read.
//
// A plain goroutine race against this (see the two-admin trials in
// concurrency_last_admin_race_test.go's style, and the cross-replica Postgres
// version in concurrency_remove_user_role_project_postgres_test.go) could NOT
// reproduce the bug reliably: the winning goroutine's unguarded write is a single
// round trip after its own unlock, while a waiting goroutine needs two round
// trips (lock-acquire, then read) before it could possibly observe stale data --
// a structural head start that, empirically (30+ trials across 2-way and 8-way
// races, local SQLite and real Postgres), let the winner's write consistently
// land before any loser's read could ever see the pre-write state. That timing
// asymmetry says nothing about correctness -- moving the write inside the lock
// closure is still required, and this file proves it -- it only means a pure
// timing race is the wrong tool to prove it deterministically in CI.
//
// This test instead forces the exact vulnerable interleaving directly, using a
// thin storage.Storage decorator that pauses ONLY the specific RemoveRole call
// RemoveUserRole's write step issues for one target -- no production code is
// touched, and every other call (the guard's read, the guard's decision, the
// second removal) goes through the real, unmodified RemoveUserRole /
// guardLastProjectAdmin / removeUserRoleUnguarded path. This reliably lands the
// interleaving the doc comment on the old code claimed couldn't happen:
//  1. Goroutine A calls RemoveUserRole for admin 1: acquires the lock, reads
//     [admin1, admin2], decides "admin2 survives", then (pre-fix: releases the
//     lock, then; post-fix: still holding the lock) blocks via the decorator
//     right before its own write lands.
//  2. A second goroutine, started once A is confirmed blocked there, calls
//     RemoveUserRole for admin 2 -- it must run in its own goroutine, since
//     post-fix it blocks trying to acquire the same lock admin1 still holds,
//     and calling it synchronously would deadlock this test against the fixed
//     code. The test waits for THIS call to either finish naturally or hit a
//     generous timeout before releasing admin1's write: pre-fix the lock is
//     already free, so admin2's whole guard-and-write sequence (several
//     sequential queries: GetUserRoleIDsExact, ListProjectRoleAssignments,
//     one GetUser per surviving holder) completes well within the window;
//     post-fix admin2's call is genuinely blocked on the lock and never
//     completes, so the timeout always elapses. An earlier version of this
//     test released admin1 as soon as admin2's FIRST guard query started
//     (not finished) -- that left a real window, between admin2's first read
//     and its later ListProjectRoleAssignments/GetUser calls, where admin1's
//     released write could land first and admin2's guard would then correctly
//     (if accidentally, from the test's point of view) refuse it, masking the
//     bug. Waiting for admin2 to actually FINISH (or definitively hang)
//     removes that ambiguity.
//  3. The test releases A's decorator; A's write commits (and, post-fix, A's
//     lock acquisition finally releases, letting step 2's call proceed).
//
// Before the fix: both writes commit -- the project ends with ZERO
// roles.assign holders. After the fix (the write moved inside the SAME
// WithNamedLock acquisition as the read+decide), step 2's RemoveUserRole call
// blocks on the lock until A's ENTIRE closure -- write included -- completes,
// then correctly observes admin1 already removed and refuses to remove the
// last remaining admin.

// admin_role_name_list_singleton_test.go — the guard half of #2496
// (INV-CORE-20).
//
// ADR-084 made `bypasses_permission_checks` the structural marker for
// "this role confers administrative authority" and retired name-based
// resolution. `installAdminRoleIDSet` nevertheless survived as a SECOND,
// separately-maintained name list for two more years of commits, because
// nothing failed when it did. It was found by a documentation audit, not by a
// check — and the recurring lesson in this repo is that a list nothing
// enumerates grows a sibling (see CLAUDE.md, "an enumeration is only as
// complete as the idioms it knows about", five recorded instances).
//
// This is the enumeration. Every occurrence of a canonical admin role NAME as a
// string literal in internal/core's non-test source must have a reviewed row
// below, saying what that occurrence is and why it is not a second
// admin-ness authority. A new occurrence fails this test, which forces the
// same classification at authoring time rather than at the next audit.
//
// Same shape as actor_sentinel_completeness_test.go's allowlist (keyed by
// "<file>:<enclosing top-level declaration>", so it survives line churn),
// including its documented trade-off: a SECOND occurrence added inside an
// ALREADY-listed declaration collapses into the same key and is not separately
// flagged. The dangerous case this guards is a NEW declaration that starts
// deciding admin-ness by name.
//
// What this does NOT do, stated explicitly per CLAUDE.md ("name mechanisms for
// what they verify, and state in the doc comment what they do not"):
//
//   - It does not prove the listed occurrences are correct, only that each was
//     looked at. The `reason` field is prose and decays like any prose.
//   - It is scoped to internal/core. A name-based admin list in server/http,
//     server/grpc or internal/cli is invisible to it. Those layers resolve
//     admin-ness by calling into core (IsGlobalAdmin, targetHasGlobalAdminRole,
//     roleSetContainsAdmin), so core is where a second authority would have to
//     live to matter — but that is an argument about likelihood, not coverage.
//   - It matches string literals, so a name assembled at runtime
//     ("super" + "_admin"), read from config, or held in a non-literal constant
//     elsewhere would slip past. No such construction exists today.
//
// The behavioural half — that the admin-role set the last-admin guards actually
// use is derived from the flag and not from any name — is
// admin_role_structural_source_test.go.

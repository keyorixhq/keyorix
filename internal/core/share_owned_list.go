// share_owned_list.go — the owner-scoped share list behind the Sharing Management page
// (SHARE-3).
//
// GET /api/v1/shares is gated on GLOBAL secrets.read, so a project-only owner (a
// project_admin of P and nothing else) could share P's secrets but could not open the
// page that lists and revokes those shares. Decision (Andrei, 2026-10-10): a caller
// without global secrets.read gets an owner-scoped list instead.
//
// The rule, for caller U:
//   - only shares U created (ShareRecord.OwnerID == U; ShareSecret only lets the
//     secret's owner create a share, and stamps it with that owner), and
//   - only on secrets whose project U is a member of NOW, per IsProjectMember (the one
//     definition, project_membership_definition.go). Removing U from P hides U's
//     shares in P at once; re-adding U shows them again. A share on a secret that no
//     longer resolves (deleted) is not listed.
//   - when the request carries a PAT least-privilege restriction (ADR-042), only on
//     secrets that token may read: the same PATRestriction.Allows(secrets.read,
//     secret's project+environment) check AuthorizeSecret makes before any read of
//     the secret itself (PAT-SCOPE-002). The route gate only proves the token may
//     read secrets SOMEWHERE; without this a token confined to project A listed the
//     owner's shares in every project.
//
// Nothing else widens it: holding global secrets.read does not add other users' shares
// here (that is GET /api/v1/shares, unchanged), and received shares are not listed.
// Machine identities are refused: a share is created by a user.

// concurrency_child_under_deleted_project_postgres_test.go — #2702, #2710,
// #2711, #2712.
//
// Four writers created or revived a child of a project while serializing only
// against a concurrent DeleteENVIRONMENT — via the EnvironmentSecretGuardLockKey
// named lock and an in-lock environment-existence check — and never against a
// concurrent DeletePROJECT, whose cascade takes no such named lock. It row-locks
// the project and sweeps the project's secrets and environments directly. So the
// entirely legitimate order
//
//	B's cascade locks the project, sweeps the children that exist (A's is not
//	inserted yet), commits
//	A inserts (or un-deletes) its child anyway
//
// left a LIVE child under a deleted project. Same end state as #2656, which was
// fixed for RestoreEnvironment only; this closes the four create/restore
// siblings using the same lockLiveParent write-then-check, now reachable from
// internal/core through the Storage.LockLiveProject method this change adds.
//
// Each test asserts the EFFECT — the count of live children under the deleted
// project — rather than A's returned error, because A is legitimately allowed
// either to fail or to be swept; what it may not do is leave a live child
// behind. That end state is reachable, not merely untidy: GetSecret and
// AuthorizeSecret do not check project liveness, so a global-scope role or an
// ACL grant still reaches the value, and the purge only ever collects
// soft-deleted rows, so the orphan outlives the project purge.
//
// What these DO NOT cover: the opposite interleaving, where A's FOR SHARE lands
// first and B's cascade blocks on it. lockLiveParent's doc comment argues that
// order is safe (the cascade's later statements take a fresh READ COMMITTED
// snapshot and see A's committed child), and the beforeA hook used here can only
// produce the order that actually caused the bug. Stated rather than left to be
// assumed covered.
//
// Reuses the two-replica fixture in
// concurrency_check_then_act_exempt_review_postgres_test.go (same package); see
// that file's header for what the GORM-callback interleaving technique does and
// does not prove.

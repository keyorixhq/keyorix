// TestSQLiteDSN_SynchronousIsAlwaysFULL pins the storage-layer half of
// ADR-112 Amendment 1's Postgres-only decision (Andrei, 2026-10-05): the fast
// audit mode has NO SQLite branch, so this DSN says FULL unconditionally and
// there is no code path, config or otherwise, that can make it say NORMAL.
//
// The guard that keeps the two halves consistent is in internal/config: a
// SQLite backend with the setting present refuses to start
// (TestConfigValidate_RejectsFastAuditModeOnSQLite). This test is the other
// side — that even if such a config somehow reached the factory, the DSN it
// builds is still durable.

// then a SECOND independent connection through OpenGormDB to read the pragma
// back) against a temp-FILE-backed database — never ":memory:", where
// journal_mode=WAL is silently downgraded and the pragma under test would not
// be exercised at all.

// Note the config here deliberately does NOT set
// InsecureAuditSkipDurableSync: that combination cannot be loaded at all
// (config validation rejects it), so constructing it here would test a state
// no deployment can reach. The reachable question is the one asked:
// does a SQLite install still get FULL now that the setting exists at all?

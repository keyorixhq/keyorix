// factory_schema_epoch_1674_test.go — #1674 regression guard.
//
// #1674's investigation and its recorded decision (docs/adr-100-schema-epoch-
// compatibility-floor.md) explicitly keep checkSchemaEpoch's refusal
// unconditional -- no grace window, no retry, no N+1 tolerance -- while making
// the refusal self-diagnosing (report the recorded-at timestamp and both
// plausible causes, in plain language, rather than deciding between them).
//
// These two tests exist so that a future "helpful" patch adding one of the
// rejected options (a time-based grace window, a bounded tolerance, an
// in-process retry loop) cannot land silently: the first proves the refusal is
// still unconditional, the second proves the diagnostic content survives.

// TestConcurrency_WithAuditCheckpointLock_MultiInstancePostgres_ExactlyOneRunsAtOnce
// exercises local_audit_checkpoint_lock.go's pg_advisory_lock across
// genuinely independent connections, the same way
// TestConcurrency_WithSchedulerLock_MultiInstancePostgres_ExactlyOneRunsAtOnce
// exercises the sibling scheduler lock: many independent LocalStorage
// instances (own *gorm.DB, own Postgres backend connection) racing the SAME
// advisory-lock key. This is the primitive #300's "chain-walk + decide +
// create checkpoint" sequence (internal/core's WriteAuditCheckpoint) is built
// on — see that function's own doc comment for the failure mode a broken
// lock reopens (a later-committed checkpoint certifying FEWER chained events
// than an earlier one, silently reopening ADR-029's truncation-detection
// gap). This test verifies the LOCK PRIMITIVE itself: at most one holder's
// critical section may run at a time, across independent connections. The
// full checkpoint decision logic (signature/truncation checks) is exercised
// separately (SQLite) in internal/core's own WriteAuditCheckpoint tests; this
// is what actually protects it on Postgres/HA, previously unverified beyond
// a single connection.

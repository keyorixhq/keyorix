//
// # Why a database trigger, and why no Go code owns this column
//
// The cache's requirement is "the stamp changes whenever ANY column of the
// cached row changes". Every Go-side mechanism for that has a hole, and this
// repo hit three of them in a row on #2764:
//
//   - updated_at alone misses UpdateColumn/UpdateColumns, which bypass GORM's
//     auto-timestamp callback. That is how a stale read_count got served and
//     reset a burn-after-N-reads budget (#133).
//   - A GORM BeforeUpdate hook calling SetColumn is SILENTLY A NO-OP for a
//     full-struct Save() — which is exactly what UpdateSecret uses.
//   - Bumping it at each write site needs every current AND future writer to
//     remember, raw db.Exec SQL included: opt-in correctness, the recurring
//     defect shape here.
//
// A trigger has none of those holes: the database does it, so Save(),
// Updates(), UpdateColumn() and raw SQL are covered identically, with no Go
// code to forget and nothing for a new writer to opt into. The column is
// read-only to GORM (models.SecretNode's `gorm:"<-:false"`) so no Go write can
// set it even by accident — and on Postgres the BEFORE trigger overwrites
// whatever a client sent anyway.
//
// # The lifecycle rule, and the bug that produced it
//
// This function originally did DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS then CREATE TRIGGER, on
// every boot, each as its own statement. That is wrong in two ways that only
// show up in a replicated deployment, because a booting replica is not the only
// replica:
//
//   - Between the DROP and the CREATE there is a live window in which the table
//     has NO trigger. Another replica serving traffic in that window updates a
//     row without bumping cache_epoch, so every warm entry for that row stays
//     "current" forever and serves pre-change data. The boot is serialised
//     against other BOOTS (both call sites run inside withMigrationLock's
//     advisory lock) but not against other replicas SERVING, which is the case
//     that matters.
//   - If the CREATE then fails — a permissions change, a disk error, a
//     cancelled context — the table is left with no trigger at all while every
//     warm replica carries on trusting its stamp.
//
// So: all of it runs in ONE transaction (DDL is transactional on both backends),
// and the normal path creates without dropping.
//
//   - Postgres: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION updates the body atomically with no
//     window at all, and because the body lives in the function the TRIGGER
//     itself never needs replacing — it is created only when absent.
//   - SQLite cannot put the body in a function, so convergence needs a compare:
//     the installed CREATE text is read from sqlite_master and compared exactly
//     against sqliteCacheEpochTriggerSQL. Equal means correct, and a correct
//     trigger is left strictly alone. Only a DIFFERING body is replaced, and
//     because that drop+create is inside the transaction, a failed create rolls
//     the drop back — the old trigger survives rather than nothing surviving.
//
// SQLite's trigger body also cannot assign to NEW (a SQLite trigger body may
// only run INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT), hence the AFTER UPDATE form with a
// nested single-row UPDATE. `WHEN NEW.cache_epoch = OLD.cache_epoch` is what
// stops that nested write re-firing the trigger: the nested write changes
// cache_epoch, so the guard is false for it. Deliberately NOT left to SQLite's
// recursive_triggers pragma (off by default, but a pragma is not something a
// migration should depend on).
//
// None of this makes the stamp trustworthy on its own — a database can lose its
// trigger by means this function never sees (pg_restore --disable-triggers, a
// schema-only restore, a bare AutoMigrate test fixture). That is why the READ
// path re-proves the trigger's existence in the same query as the stamp; see
// readLiveNodeStamp.

// namedLockRegistry hands out one *sync.Mutex per lock key, creating it on
// first use, so the non-Postgres WithNamedLock fallback (SQLite,
// single-process by construction) serializes callers per-key exactly like
// PostgreSQL's pg_advisory_lock does -- not one shared mutex serializing every
// unrelated key against every other. FIX-5 (adversarial review run 2): this
// replaces a single process-wide *sync.Mutex that WAS shared across every
// lock key -- with the reentrancy guard now keyed on lockKey (see
// namedLockHeldCtxKey), a nested WithNamedLock call under a DIFFERENT key
// must actually be able to acquire its OWN lock rather than either
// (old, wrong) silently skipping it, or (a naive per-key reentrancy fix atop
// the OLD single shared mutex) self-deadlocking by re-locking the same mutex
// the outer call already holds.
//
// #1690 regression (Part 2 regression audit, 2026-09-04): FIX-5's own map
// (originally map[string]*sync.Mutex) never deleted an entry once created --
// lockKey's key space is per-entity (sodGrantLockKey("user"/"group", ID),
// projectAdminGuardLockKey(projectID)), so on a long-uptime SQLite/
// single-process deployment the map grows by one entry per distinct
// user/group/project ID ever role-managed and never shrinks: an unbounded
// memory-growth surface the old single-mutex design had no way to exhibit,
// by construction. Fixed with a refcounted entry: acquire increments refs
// under r.mu before locking the entry's own mutex; release decrements refs
// (also under r.mu) after unlocking it and deletes the map entry only once
// refs reaches zero -- i.e. only once no goroutine anywhere in the process is
// still holding or waiting on that specific entry. A racing acquire for the
// same key between another caller's unlock and its release either sees the
// entry still in the map (bumps refs, reuses the SAME mutex object -- no
// correctness gap) or finds it already deleted (creates a fresh one for a
// genuinely uncontended key) -- there is never a window where two different
// mutex objects are live for the same key at once.
// #2853: the entry is an explicit FIFO ticket queue, not a sync.Mutex. Three
// properties the mutex could not give, each load-bearing:
//
//   - CONTEXT-AWARENESS. A waiter whose ctx is cancelled must leave the queue
//     and return, having touched no pooled connection. sync.Mutex.Lock cannot
//     be cancelled, so a caller abandoned by its request context stayed queued.
//   - FIFO. sync.Mutex deliberately allows barging (a newly arriving goroutine
//     can win over one already waiting) and only falls back to a FIFO-ish
//     starvation mode after 1ms. For a lock that guards a cross-replica
//     check-then-act sequence, "first to ask is first served" is the behaviour
//     an operator expects, and it bounds worst-case latency per waiter.
//   - A CHECKABLE held/queued STATE. The Postgres path below must be entered by
//     at most one goroutine per key per process (see WithNamedLock's connection
//     budget note), which means the gate has to be inspectable, not implicit in
//     a mutex's internals.
//
// held is true while some caller owns the key. Release hands ownership to the
// head of the queue by closing its ticket WITHOUT clearing held, so no third
// goroutine can slip in between a release and its successor's wake-up.

// sodGrantLockKey("user", userID) -- a different resource, not covered by the

// Part 2 regression audit (adversarial review run 2), found in FIX-5 itself:

// connection via sqlDB.Conn(ctx), so a call chain nesting N distinct keys
// needed N simultaneous pooled connections. Under a constrained pool (e.g.
// max_open_conns: 1 or 2, unenforced by internal/config), the outer call
// holds the pool's only connection for the ENTIRE duration of fn -- which is
// itself the blocked inner call waiting on sqlDB.Conn(ctx) for a connection
// only the outer call could release. Verified: an indefinite deadlock (not
// contention -- it never resolved on its own; only an artificial context
// timeout ended it), reproduced against real Postgres with MaxOpenConns(1).

// WithNamedLock runs fn with every OTHER caller using the identical lockKey

//
//  1. a per-key in-process FIFO queue (namedLockRegistry), which every caller
//     passes through FIRST, on every dialect;
//  2. on PostgreSQL only, a session-scoped advisory lock (pg_advisory_lock)
//     keyed by lockKey's FNV-1a hash, which extends the guarantee across
//     processes/replicas (ADR-039 HA). SQLite is single-instance by
//     construction, so layer 1 is the whole guarantee there.
//
// Two DIFFERENT lock keys never serialize against each other in either layer.
//
// Like WithBootstrapLock/WithAuditCheckpointLock, this BLOCKS until the lock is
// acquired rather than skipping on contention — a caller that loses the race must
// actually re-run its check under the lock and observe the winner's now-committed
// state, not silently no-op. It now also honours ctx while blocked: a caller whose
// context is cancelled or times out while queued returns that error instead of
// waiting indefinitely, and does so without ever having taken a connection.
//
// # Connection budget (#2853, and why layer 1 exists)
//
// The bound is TWO pooled connections per contended key PER PROCESS — one for
// the advisory-lock session, one for the work inside fn — no matter how many
// callers are contending. It is NOT two per caller.
//
// That ordering is the whole point. Taking the advisory lock requires a pooled
// connection, and pg_advisory_lock BLOCKS while holding it; fn then needs a
// further connection to do the caller's actual work. Before layer 1 existed,
// every waiter checked out a connection and parked it for the entire wait, so
// with max_open_conns = M (internal/config; configs/test.yaml sets 10) M
// concurrent callers on one key exhausted the pool and the HOLDER could not get
// a connection to finish — a permanent deadlock, not contention, taking down
// unrelated traffic sharing the pool. Reproduced on a pool of 2 with two
// callers: the holder failed inside its own critical section.
//
// Layer 1 fixes it by construction: at most one goroutine per key per process
// is ever past the queue, so at most one connection per key is ever parked on
// pg_advisory_lock. Waiters hold nothing. A cancelled waiter leaves the queue
// having touched no connection at all.
//
// Guards: TestWithNamedLock_ManyWaitersOnOneKey_DoNotExhaustPool and
// TestWithNamedLock_HolderCompletesUnderPoolSmallerThanWaiters (both wedge
// without layer 1), TestWithNamedLock_CancelledWhileQueued_ReleasesAndTakesNoConnection.
//
// Nothing inside fn may ask the pool for a connection beyond that second one.
// Lock ordering across DIFFERENT keys is unchanged and still the caller's
// responsibility: two call chains taking keys A then B and B then A deadlock,
// exactly as they did when both layers were advisory locks — layer 1 just makes
// such a cycle resolve in-process rather than in Postgres.
//
// fn receives the (possibly lock-marked) context so that a nested WithNamedLock
// call made from within fn, under the SAME lockKey, sees the marker via
// namedLockHeldCtxKey and runs directly instead of re-acquiring: the outer lock
// already gives this call chain exclusivity over every other goroutine/replica
// for that key. A nested call under a DIFFERENT lockKey is not covered by the
// outer lock at all and still acquires its own. Callers that thread ctx through
// to further WithNamedLock calls MUST use the ctx passed to fn, not whatever ctx

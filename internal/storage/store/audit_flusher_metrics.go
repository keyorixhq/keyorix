// audit_flusher_metrics.go — Prometheus instrumentation for the audit-chain
// batching flusher (SESSION-PERF, #2403 follow-up, item 3; coordinator review
// on #2420 asked for this to be instrumented rather than tuned blind).
//
// Group commit's whole value proposition is "batch more, fsync less" — without
// visibility into the batch sizes actually achieved in production, there is no
// way to tell whether the chosen linger window (auditFlusherLingerWindow) is
// still the right tradeoff as load shape changes, or to notice a regression
// that silently shrinks batches back toward one-at-a-time. These two series
// live on the default Prometheus registry the server exposes at GET /metrics
// (same as every other counter/histogram in this codebase — see
// server/middleware/scheduler_metrics.go for the sibling pattern this mirrors).
//
// batchSize is a Summary, not a Histogram: this package has no per-instance
// aggregation need (a single server's own p50/p95 is what operators and this
// session's own benchmarking both want directly, not a cross-instance roll-up),
// and a Summary reports exact client-side quantiles with no bucket-boundary
// interpolation — the simpler, more precise choice when cross-instance
// aggregation isn't a requirement.

// FIX-5 (adversarial review run 2): a nested WithNamedLock call under a
// DIFFERENT key from the one already held must actually acquire its own
// lock, not silently skip acquisition because SOME lock (a different one) is
// already held by this call chain. Before this fix, the reentrancy guard was
// a single untyped boolean keyed on "is any lock held at all" -- so
// SetProjectMemberRole holding projectAdminGuardLockKey(projectID) and then
// calling AssignUserRole, which needs its own sodGrantLockKey("user", userID),
// never actually took the second lock, losing AssignUserRole's cross-replica
// SoD check-then-act serialization entirely whenever reached through that
// call chain.
//
// Proven here by holding "key-B" open in one goroutine and confirming a
// nested WithNamedLock(ctx, "key-B", ...) call -- issued from inside an outer
// WithNamedLock(ctx, "key-A", ...) closure on a SEPARATE call chain -- blocks
// until the first goroutine releases it. Under the old bug, the nested call
// would return immediately (wrongly treating key-B as already covered by
// key-A's own lock), which this test's ordering assertion would catch.

// local_audit_chain_gate_contention_test.go — the blocker the coordinator's
// review of #2637 found: the in-process SQLite write gate's error was invisible
// to this package's busy classifier, and #2420's bisection turned that into
// unbounded amplification.
//
// Two separate defects, one cause:
//
//  1. isSQLiteBusyErr matched only SQLITE_BUSY / "database is locked". Once the
//     gate exists, contention is resolved by WAITING in-process and reported as
//     storage.ErrSQLiteWriteContention — so the DOMINANT contention error on
//     SQLite stopped being covered by the retry budget that exists for exactly
//     this condition. SQLITE_BUSY survives only for what the gate does not cover
//     (autocommit writes, a second *sql.DB handle in one process).
//
//  2. commitAuditBatch bisected on it. Its doc comment anticipated a contention
//     failure and dismissed it — "every leaf gets the same outcome … only adds a
//     few harmless extra attempts" — but that reasoning depends on the CTX
//     HAVING EXPIRED, which is what makes each leaf fail instantly. The gate
//     gives up after its own bound while auditWriteContext's deadline can still
//     be live, so each of a 256-item batch's ~511 leaves can queue for the full
//     bound AGAIN. A bounded single failure becomes an unbounded serial
//     amplification, under precisely the load the gate was built to bound — and
//     recordAuditFlush fires once per recursion level, corrupting
//     keyorix_audit_flusher_batch_size / _flushes_total at exactly the moment an
//     operator is reading them.
//
// Only reachable under load, which is why it needs a guard rather than a
// comment: the error is injected directly here instead of by generating real
// contention, so the classification and the no-bisect decision are tested
// without a timing-dependent fixture.

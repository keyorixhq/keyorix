// local_bootstrap_lock.go — serializes BootstrapSystem's first-admin seeding
// sequence (ADR-039 HA) across every replica.
//
// BootstrapSystem's "is this a fresh install" check through admin/RBAC/project
// seeding was previously guarded only by a KeyorixCore-level sync.Mutex
// (bootstrapMu), which serializes concurrent callers within ONE server process
// but does nothing for two different replicas of an HA deployment racing
// POST /system/init against the same shared database: each replica's mutex
// only guards its own process, so both can observe "not yet initialised"
// before either's write is visible to the other and each independently seed a
// "first admin" — a duplicate-admin race and/or partially corrupted RBAC seed
// (#core-auth-03).

// (pg_advisory_lock) extends that across processes/replicas (ADR-039 HA).

// than skipping on contention — a replica that loses the race must actually
// re-run its "already initialised?" check under the lock and observe the
// winner's now-committed state, not silently no-op (which would leave its
// caller waiting on a response that never seeds anything and never reports
// AlreadyInitialized either).

// WithTransaction runs fn inside a single GORM transaction. fn receives a
// transaction-scoped LocalStorage: every mutation it makes is committed together when
// fn returns nil, and rolled back together if fn returns an error (or panics). The
// transaction-scoped store shares the parent's audit-chain, audit-checkpoint, and
// bootstrap mutexes so an audit append, checkpoint write, or bootstrap seed inside
// the transaction still serializes correctly (ADR-029/#339).
//
// It also shares the parent's read-path cache POINTER but deliberately does NOT
// copy cacheEnabled, so every read inside the transaction goes live. That is
// required, not a tuning choice: a tx-scoped store reads through the
// transaction handle, so it sees uncommitted generations and uncommitted data,
// and publishing those into a cache that outlives the transaction lets a
// rolled-back answer be served once a later committed write reproduces the same
// generation value. See cacheEnabled's doc comment on LocalStorage. Going live
// inside the transaction is also strictly more correct for read-your-own-writes
// — the transaction handle sees its own uncommitted writes, a cache hit would
// not.

// fast_audit_mode_test.go — ADR-112 Amendment 1 / FASTAUDIT-1
// (docs/specs/fast-audit-mode.md): the store-layer guards for the opt-in
// fast audit mode.
//
// What these tests DO cover: the default is durable; the Postgres mechanism
// is exactly `SET LOCAL synchronous_commit = off` and only on the audit
// transaction; that setting does not leak to the next transaction borrowing
// the same pooled connection; fail-closed-on-write-failure survives the mode;
// a transaction-scoped clone never inherits it.
//
// What they do NOT cover, stated per this repo's own standing lesson ("name
// mechanisms for what they verify, and state in the doc comment what they do
// not"): they do not prove anything about what survives an OS crash or power
// loss. No Go test can — losing the OS page cache is outside the process's
// control. The crash-resistance claim is tested, as far as it can be, by
// fast_audit_mode_crash_test.go (a real kill -9 loop, plus a mechanical
// SQLite WAL-tail truncation that models the lost-tail case directly).

// the database directly via GORM. Used by the server itself and for
// air-gapped / offline deployments.
//
// A second backend, RemoteStorage (proxying operations to a running Keyorix
// server via the REST API, used by the pre-ADR-108 thick CLI), was deleted
// entirely in ADR-108 Phase 6 step 14b-2 once the CLI switch (Phase 5) made
// it unreachable in any supported deployment. Each operation file that used
// to pair a remote_*.go with a local_*.go now stands alone.

// # Entry Point

// Start here. Read this comment, then open the single operation file you need.
// You do NOT need to read all files — each file is self-contained.

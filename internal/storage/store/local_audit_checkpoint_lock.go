// local_audit_checkpoint_lock.go — serializes the audit-checkpoint write path

// WriteAuditCheckpoint's chain-walk + decide + create-checkpoint sequence is
// reachable from three unsynchronized triggers: the background scheduler tick,
// an operator's POST /api/v1/audit/checkpoint call, and the gRPC
// WriteAuditCheckpoint RPC. With no lock, two overlapping calls — including two
// landing on different replicas under ADR-039 HA — can interleave and commit a
// checkpoint out of chain-length order: the row with the higher DB id can end
// up certifying FEWER chained events than an earlier-committed row, silently
// reopening the truncation-detection gap ADR-029 exists to close (#300).

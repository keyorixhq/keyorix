// concurrency_audit_persist_loss_test.go — contended variant of the "any
// mutation path emits exactly one audit event" invariant.
//
// TestExpireSetupToken_Invariant_ExactlyOneAuditEventWithCorrectActor
// (internal/core/setup_token_expire_audit_test.go, #1622) and its siblings
// prove that invariant against a MockStorage: LogAuditEvent always succeeds
// instantly because it's a mock call, not a real write. That is real,
// necessary coverage for the CODE PATH (does the right call happen at all),
// but it structurally cannot fail on a defect that only appears under
// storage-level contention -- which is exactly what production hit: a
// 30-minute sustained-load measurement (docs/adr-100-mlockall-removal-
// deployment-swap-control.md) logged 704 "database is locked (SQLITE_BUSY)"
// audit-persist failures out of ~27k iterations at 25 concurrent HTTP
// clients. Traced (see #1727 and the #1679 follow-up round's Step 1
// report): the mutation (e.g. CreateSecret) and its audit write are
// separate SQLite transactions with no atomicity between them -- emitAudit
// (internal/core/service.go) logs and drops on failure, and the real HTTP
// call sites dispatch the audit write via goSafe (fire-and-forget goroutine,
// see server/http/handlers/secrets_crud.go), so a secret can be durably
// created while its audit record is silently lost.
//
// This test reproduces the storage-layer half of that gap directly: real
// concurrent goroutines, a real file-backed SQLite database with the same
// pragmas production uses, driving real LocalStorage.CreateSecret calls
// each immediately followed (same goroutine, no goSafe indirection -- that
// async-dispatch problem is separate and already reported) by a real
// LocalStorage.LogAuditEvent call. It asserts the count of persisted audit
// records equals the count of successful mutations exactly, with no
// tolerance. Fixed (#1727) by a jittered busy-retry loop inside
// LogAuditEvent itself (local_audit_chain.go) -- confirmed to fail this
// exact test before that fix landed (reverting the retry loop to a single
// attempt reproduces ~2-6% drops here, consistent with production's ~2.6%).

// Why: production's real 10s busy_timeout DID eventually get exhausted
// under real sustained load (25 concurrent clients, 30 real minutes), but
// reproducing that exact timescale in a unit test is impractical -- a test
// suite cannot spend 30 minutes proving one invariant. A short busy_timeout
// makes the identical contention (multiple real transactions against the
// same database file, one on secret_nodes, one on audit_events, released
// simultaneously) exhaust its retry budget in milliseconds instead of
// minutes. This is a faithful, scaled-down reproduction of the same failure
// mechanism, not a synthetic one: the lock contention is real SQLite
// behavior, only the patience budget is compressed.

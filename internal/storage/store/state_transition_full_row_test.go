// state_transition_full_row_test.go — INV-STORE-14 (#2510), the zero-value half.
// A conditional state transition persists every column it OWNS in the same
// UPDATE as the state change, including columns the caller set to their zero
// value: a plain struct Updates skips zero values, so without an explicit
// Select the write would silently keep a stale column while still reporting
// matched=true.
//
// TransitionMachineIdentityState still uses Select("*") for this.
// TransitionSecretStatus does NOT any more — #2695 narrowed it to
// Select("Status", "UpdatedAt"), because a full-row write reverted every column
// a narrower concurrent writer had changed since the caller's read. See
// TestTransitionSecretStatus_WritesOnlyStatusAndUpdatedAt below for the full
// reasoning and for how the zero-value property is preserved. The fromState predicate and real-Postgres concurrency halves of
// INV-STORE-14/15 are covered by local_state_transition_cas_test.go and the
// concurrency_*_postgres_test.go files.

// TestTransitionSecretStatus_WritesOnlyStatusAndUpdatedAt replaces what used to
// be TestTransitionSecretStatus_PersistsFullRowIncludingZeroValues, and it is the
// ONE place #2695 inverts an existing assertion rather than adding one — so the
// reasoning belongs here, in full.
//
// The old test asserted that clearing Description and Classification on the
// in-memory struct persisted those clears, i.e. it pinned Select("*"). #2695
// identifies that exact behaviour as the defect: this method's only callers
// (SuspendSecret, ResumeSecret) set Status and UpdatedAt and nothing else, so
// every other column it wrote came from a read that is already stale by the time
// the CAS runs — reverting a concurrent read-count increment (a spent MaxReads
// budget), an ownership clear, a classification change or a rotation-config
// change. The CAS stopped it resurrecting a deleted row; it did not stop it
// losing those updates.
//
// What about the zero-value property the old test was built around (GORM's
// struct-based Updates skips zero values, so a column the method owns could
// silently keep a stale value while still reporting matched=true)? It does not
// apply to this method any more, and this test does not pretend to cover it. The
// two remaining in-scope columns are Status — which no caller ever sets to ""
// (both set a non-empty constant) — and UpdatedAt, which GORM stamps itself on
// an Updates against a model carrying that field. I wrote a subtest for it first
// and then confirmed by mutation that it passed with the Select removed
// entirely, i.e. it asserted nothing; it is deleted rather than kept as decoration.
// The whitelist's job here is purely EXCLUSION — keeping the other columns out —
// which is what the one remaining subtest asserts, and what goes red when the
// Select is widened back to "*".
//
// TransitionMachineIdentityState still needs the inclusion half (it writes
// RevokedAt and clears Description/Classification), so its sibling test above is
// unchanged.

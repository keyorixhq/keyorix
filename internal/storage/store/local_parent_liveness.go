// lockLiveParent re-reads the parent row matching where/args inside tx and reports
// whether it still exists (live). On Postgres it takes SELECT ... FOR SHARE on that
// row, so it serializes against the parent's delete cascade, which UPDATEs (and
// therefore row-locks) the parent row before it sweeps the children. SQLite has no
// row lock, so the clause is omitted there and the transaction alone serializes it
// (SQLite is always single-process — same split as LockMachineIdentityForUpdate).
//
// Callers MUST call this AFTER their own child write, inside the same transaction,
// and roll back when it returns false. Write-then-check is what makes this sound
// under READ COMMITTED, in every interleaving with a cascade that locks the parent
// row first:
//   - the cascade locked the parent first: this read blocks until the cascade
//     commits, then sees the parent deleted (Postgres re-checks the WHERE against the
//     committed row version), and the caller rolls its child write back;
//   - this read locked the parent first: the cascade's parent UPDATE blocks until
//     this transaction commits, so every later cascade statement (a fresh snapshot
//     under READ COMMITTED) sees the committed child row and sweeps it.
//
// Checking BEFORE the write instead is not enough: a cascade that runs entirely
// between the check and the write never sees the child, and the child commits under
// a deleted parent. What this does NOT cover: a delete path that sweeps the children
// before it touches (and so locks) the parent row — every such cascade must lock the
// parent row first for this to hold.

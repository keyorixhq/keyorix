// local_named_lock_pool_starvation_postgres_test.go — #2853: WithNamedLock
// must not let contention on one key exhaust the connection pool.
//
// The defect: the Postgres path checked a connection out of the pool and then
// blocked on pg_advisory_lock STILL HOLDING IT, while the lock holder needed a
// further connection to do its work inside fn. With max_open_conns = M, M
// concurrent callers on one key occupied the pool and the holder could never
// finish — a permanent deadlock, and the pool is shared by every request in the
// process, so it took down unrelated traffic too.
//
// The fix: a per-key in-process FIFO queue, entered BEFORE any connection is
// taken, so at most one goroutine per key per process ever reaches
// pg_advisory_lock. Waiters hold no connection; a cancelled waiter leaves the
// queue having taken none at all.
//
// Every test here is bounded by a context deadline rather than left to hang, so
// on an unfixed build it FAILS with a diagnosis instead of wedging CI for the
// package timeout. Each one wedges without the queue and passes with it.

// fast_audit_mode_postgres_crash_test.go — the Postgres half of ADR-112
// Amendment 1's crash requirement (FASTAUDIT-1, docs/specs/fast-audit-mode.md
// §S3). Its SQLite counterpart is fast_audit_mode_crash_test.go.
//
// WHY THIS NEEDS ITS OWN GATE, AND WHY IT CAN NEVER RUN IN CI. On SQLite the
// database lives in this process, so a kill -9 of the test's own worker is a
// genuine crash of the thing holding the data. On Postgres it is not: killing
// the Keyorix process does nothing to the database server, and the spec says
// so explicitly (a Keyorix process crash loses nothing). The only event that
// can lose an async commit on Postgres is the POSTMASTER dying with WAL still
// in its shared buffers — so testing the claim means killing the postmaster,
// which means controlling the database server's lifecycle. That is outside
// what a `go test ./...` run may assume, so this test is gated on the operator
// explicitly naming a disposable container:
//
//	docker run -d --name kx-crash-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pg -p 32790:5432 postgres:16
//	KX_FASTAUDIT_PG_CRASH_CONTAINER=kx-crash-pg \
//	KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN="host=localhost port=32790 user=postgres password=pg dbname=postgres sslmode=disable" \
//	  go test ./internal/storage/store/ -run TestFastAuditMode_PostgresCrashLosesOnlyATail -v
//
// A fixed published port matters: `docker start` re-rolls a `-p 0:5432`
// mapping, so the reconnect after the restart would hit a port nothing is
// listening on. The first attempt at this test failed exactly that way.
//
// Verification class for docs/security-closures.tsv purposes: MANUAL. This
// test skips in every automated environment by construction, and a skip here
// is correct rather than a failure. The run that matters is recorded in this
// change's PR body with its real output.

// TestFastAuditMode_PostgresCrashLosesOnlyATail writes async-committed audit
// events, SIGKILLs the postmaster WHILE writes are in flight, restarts it, and
// asserts the two things the mode promises:
//
//   - whatever was lost is a clean TAIL of the written order, never a gap in
//     the middle;
//   - the hash chain still verifies.
//
// The kill has to land mid-write, not after the loop. Postgres's WAL writer
// flushes every wal_writer_delay (200ms by default), so a kill a moment after
// the last write finds nothing at risk — the first version of this test killed
// after the loop and lost 0 of 640 rows, which looks like a pass but proves
// nothing about tail loss. The positive control below turns that outcome into
// a visible "this run proved nothing" rather than a silent green.

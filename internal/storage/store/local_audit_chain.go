// POSTGRES ONLY. Callers must already have established that tx's dialect is
// postgres. There is NO SQLite counterpart, and deliberately never was in a
// shipped build: the mode is PostgreSQL-only (Andrei's decision, 2026-10-05)
// and config validation REFUSES TO START a SQLite backend that sets the key
// (internal/config's auditSkipDurableSyncSQLiteUnsupportedError), so a
// SQLite-backed LocalStorage can never reach this function with skip == true.
// SQLite's own DSN says `_synchronous=FULL` unconditionally and has no other
// branch. See config.DatabaseConfig.InsecureAuditSkipDurableSync for the two
// reasons SQLite was rejected (a per-connection pragma would relax every
// table, not just audit; and the measured p99 got worse under concurrency).
//
// skip == false (the default, and the secure baseline) is a strict NO-OP: no
// statement is issued at all, so the default path is byte-identical to what it
// was before this setting existed — no extra round trip, nothing to regress,
// and nothing that could accidentally override a cluster- or role-level
// synchronous_commit an operator set deliberately.
//
// skip == true issues `SET LOCAL synchronous_commit = off`. Three properties
// make this the right mechanism rather than a bigger one:
//
//   - SET LOCAL is TRANSACTION-scoped: it reverts at COMMIT/ROLLBACK, so it
//     can never leak to the next transaction that borrows this pooled
//     connection. That is what confines the relaxation to the audit
//     transaction and leaves a concurrent secret WRITE committing durably.
//   - synchronous_commit is evaluated AT COMMIT TIME, so setting it from
//     inside the transaction is what actually takes effect for this
//     transaction's commit (it is not a connect-time-only GUC).
//   - The WAL record is still written, in order. Async commit removes the WAIT
//     for the flush, not the write and not the ordering — which is exactly why
//     a crash can only truncate the audit chain's TAIL and can never gap or
//     fork it: recovery replays a valid PREFIX of a single totally-ordered WAL
//     stream, so a surviving row's prev_hash always points at a row that also
//     survived. A synchronous commit elsewhere flushes WAL up to its own LSN
//     and therefore makes every EARLIER async commit durable too, so the
//     inversion ("a later audit row survives while an earlier one is lost")
//     has no mechanism by which to happen. See the spec §5 and
//     TestFastAuditMode_PostgresCrashLosesOnlyATail.

// computeAuditEntryHash hashes an event's semantically meaningful fields plus

// id is excluded — it is unknown before insert and chain linkage already pins
// position. event_time is encoded as Unix microseconds to round-trip
// identically on Postgres (µs precision) and SQLite.
//
// Length-prefixing (not a delimiter byte) is required for the encoding to be
// injective: several of these fields are free-form strings that can
// legitimately (or, via IngestAuditEventProxy's raw passthrough on
// SQLite-backed deployments — Postgres TEXT columns reject embedded NUL
// outright, so this was only ever live there) contain ANY byte value,
// including a delimiter byte. A single NUL-separated write() (the prior
// scheme) is then non-injective: "a\x00" + "bc" and "a" + "\x00bc" concatenate
// to the identical byte stream and therefore hash identically, even though
// the field values differ — defeating the tamper-evidence guarantee this hash
// chain exists to provide. A length prefix carried out-of-band (as a fixed-
// width binary integer, never as characters that could themselves be part of
// the content) removes that ambiguity regardless of what bytes a field
// contains.
//
// BREAKING CHANGE / no backward compatibility with pre-fix hashes: this
// encoding is NOT the same byte stream the old NUL-delimited scheme produced,
// even for a field that never contained a NUL byte — so the change is a hash-
// format break, not a content-preserving refactor. VerifyAuditChain re-derives
// every row's entry_hash from this same function (see verifyBatchEvents), so
// on any deployment that already has chained audit_events rows written before
// this fix, re-verifying those rows post-upgrade WILL recompute a different
// hash than what is stored and report the chain broken at the first pre-
// upgrade row — indistinguishable, from VerifyAuditChain's callers' point of
// view, from real tampering. There is no per-row encoding-version marker in
// the schema to let verification pick the right algorithm per row (adding one
// is a real schema migration, out of scope here), and the existing retention
// re-anchor mechanism (audit_retention_anchor.go) does not help either — it
// only substitutes the genesis-prevHash requirement for the anchored row, it
// does not skip re-deriving that row's own entry_hash. Coordinating a fix for
// deployments with pre-existing audit history (e.g. a one-time migration that
// re-derives entry_hash/prev_hash for every existing row under this new
// encoding, in ascending id order, before the upgrade takes live traffic) is
// left to the integrating release process; this change intentionally does not
// attempt that migration itself, per this change's own review discussion.

//
// A GENUINE (non-busy) failure on a multi-item batch does NOT fail every
// item in the batch (coordinator review, #2420, item 3: "one bad item must
// not fail the batch"). It bisects instead, retrying each half
// independently — a single poisoned item (e.g. one access-log row
// violating a constraint) only ever fails itself, isolated down through
// O(log n) extra transaction attempts, not the N-1 unrelated reads that
// happened to share its batch window. Every surviving item still gets full
// chain-linkage: each sub-batch attempt re-reads the CURRENT chain head
// fresh from the table, so whichever sub-batch commits first (these all run
// sequentially on the one flusher goroutine, never concurrently with each
// other) correctly becomes the next sub-batch's starting point — the same
// "some total order, not a causal-order claim" guarantee the single
// un-split batch always provided.
//
// A batch that fails only because busy-retry exhausted its budget (ctx
// expired under sustained contention) bisects the same way and every leaf
// gets the same outcome (nothing committed, same error) — bisection doesn't
// change that case's result, only adds a few harmless extra attempts.
//
// That last sentence is TRUE ONLY WHEN THE CTX HAS EXPIRED, which is what makes
// each leaf fail instantly. The in-process SQLite write gate (#2637) breaks that
// premise and is therefore excluded explicitly below: the gate gives up after its
// own bound while the item's auditWriteContext deadline can still be live, so
// every leaf of the recursion can queue for the FULL bound again. A 256-item
// batch has ~511 leaves, so a single bounded failure becomes an unbounded serial
// amplification — under precisely the sustained-contention load the gate exists
// to bound. recordAuditFlush also fires once per recursion level, which would

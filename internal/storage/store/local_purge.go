// so an in-flight record is never destroyed by a too-short window.

// DeleteAnomalyAlertsBefore hard-deletes anomaly alerts matching either of two

//     excludes in-flight rows (open campaigns, active break-glass, pending access
//     requests) from age-based deletion, an old alert nobody has ever acknowledged
//     is exactly the in-flight case here: it is still a live, unreviewed security
//     signal, not a resolved record, so it is NOT matched by this clause alone.
//     Without this gate, a retention window shorter than the real review cadence

// only ever reconciles the SAME user's row at their own next activation in the

// leaves their row 'active' in the DB indefinitely otherwise; this retention
// sweep is the backstop that still reclaims it. A row genuinely still active
// (ExpiresAt in the future, or nil) is never touched either way.
//
// FIX-7 (adversarial review run 2): #1653 reopened's widen hard-deleted a
// still-'active' row in the SAME statement as the reconciliation, the instant
// its ExpiresAt passed the retention cutoff -- racing any concurrent operation
// that expected to still find the row (in ANY state) to act on it, e.g. an
// admin's RevokeBreakGlass, which removes the real RBAC grant
// (c.RemoveUserRole) FIRST and only afterward conditionally updates this row
// (RevokeBreakGlassActivation, whose WHERE already accepts BOTH 'active' and
// 'expired' for exactly this reason). If the purge deletes the row between
// those two steps, the already-successful revoke's own state-transition and
// audit-event write (LogBreakGlassRevoked, only called on success) are lost --
// the caller sees a misleading "activation is not active" error despite
// having just genuinely revoked the grant.
//
// Fixed by reconciling and deleting as two separate steps: a row transitioned
// 'active' -> 'expired' by THIS call is deliberately excluded from THIS
// call's own delete and left for the NEXT sweep to hard-delete -- its
// CreatedAt does not change at reconciliation, so it would otherwise ALSO
// match the terminal-row delete criteria in this same pass (CreatedAt <=
// ExpiresAt < before already holds); explicitly tracking and excluding the
// IDs this call itself just reconciled is what actually defers them. On the
// next sweep they're no longer excluded and qualify like any other
// already-terminal row, giving one full sweep interval of grace for a
// concurrent revoke (or any other in-flight reader) to still observe and act
// on the row before it's purged. The original #edee956e/#1653 guarantee this
// widen exists for is unaffected: an abandoned 'active' row is still
// reconciled (freeing the partial-unique-index slot) on every sweep, just
// hard-deleted one cycle later than before.

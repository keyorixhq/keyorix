// process; nothing previously stopped two separate OS processes pointed at the
// same local SQLite file from racing DDL statements. This simulates a second
// OS process by acquiring the lock a second time via a second, independent
// open of the same lock file (an flock is scoped to the open file description,
// not the process, so two separate os.OpenFile calls model two separate
// processes for this purpose) while the first holder still has it, and asserts
// the second attempt fails fast (non-blocking) with an actionable error rather
// than hanging or silently succeeding.

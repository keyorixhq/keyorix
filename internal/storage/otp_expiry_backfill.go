// LegacyOneTimePasswordGrace is how long a one-time password that already existed
// when users.one_time_password_expires_at was introduced keeps working: upgrade time
// plus this window (OTP-EXPIRY-1).
//
// It equals the recover-admin default (24h), the shortest of the two defaults, on
// purpose: the legacy rows cannot be told apart by kind (see
// backfillLegacyOneTimePasswordExpiry), and the riskiest of them is a recover-admin
// credential on an admin account, so the rule is sized for that one.
const LegacyOneTimePasswordGrace = 24 * time.Hour

// backfillLegacyOneTimePasswordExpiry gives every live account that is still waiting
// on a password change an expiry of now + LegacyOneTimePasswordGrace.
//
// Before OTP-EXPIRY-1 nothing recorded that a password was a one-time one, and the
// two creators (admin `--one-time-password`, recover-admin) leave the account in
// exactly the state an admin-forced reset or an expired-password gate does:
// password_reset_required, with the password hash set. The two cannot be separated
// afterwards (password_changed_at and updated_at are written by both and bumped by
// failed logins), so the rule fails closed: every password_reset_required account
// gets the window, and an account whose owner has not changed their password by then
// has to be re-issued a one-time password by an admin. The alternative (leaving them
// all without an expiry) would keep every pre-upgrade recover-admin password valid
// forever, which is the gap this change closes.
//
// pending_first_login is not touched: those accounts hold a random unusable
// password, and the credential is a setup link with its own expiry.
//
// NOT idempotent by design: it must run exactly once, in the same transaction that
// adds the column (factory.go). Re-running it on a later boot would put an expiry on
// accounts forced into a reset after the upgrade.

// TestCompanionIndexes_CreatedOnUpgrade pins the gap left behind by the #490/#761
// columnExists/tableExists SQLite fix: several columns models/models.go tags
// `gorm:"index"` are added to an EXISTING table only via a raw `ALTER TABLE ADD
// COLUMN` (gated on columnExists), never through AutoMigrate — migrateDatabase's
// full, struct-driven `db.AutoMigrate(...)` block only ever runs once, on a
// genuinely fresh install (`if projectsExists { return nil }` short-circuits it
// for every upgrade). A fresh install therefore gets the companion index for
// free via AutoMigrate; an upgraded install previously never did, silently
// degrading classification/certificate-expiry/audit-chain queries to full table
// scans as these tables grow.
//
// Simulate an upgraded install by: booting once against a fresh file (which
// creates the full, fully-indexed schema, exactly like any real fresh install),
// dropping just the target companion index to stand in for "this deployment
// predates the fix that added it" (the column, added many releases ago via the
// same raw-ALTER path, is already present either way), then re-running
// migrateDatabase directly against the same *gorm.DB — the exact call a second
// process boot makes — and confirming the companion index re-converges.

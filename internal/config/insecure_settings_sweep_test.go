// insecure_settings_sweep_test.go — the half of ADR-112's opt-out rule that
// looks OUTWARD, at Config, instead of inward at the registry.
//
// The coordinator's 2026-10-06 review named the gap precisely: the registry's
// own structural test validates only entries ALREADY in the registry, and since
// every entry's Name is a synthetic insecure_-prefixed path whether or not the
// YAML key was renamed, that test passes no matter what Config grows next to
// it. "There is no violation count for an exception to be excluded from,
// because no sweep of the config surface exists." This file is that sweep.
//
// It has two nets, because one is provably not enough:
//
//  1. A LEXICAL net over every leaf in Config's YAML surface: a key whose name
//     reads like an opt-out (allow_, disable, skip_, unsafe, insecure_,
//     keyless) must be covered by a registry entry's SourcePaths or carry a
//     written exemption. This catches the common shape and names the offender
//     exactly.
//
//  2. A SET ratchet over the same surface (testdata/config_surface_leaves.txt).
//     This is not belt-and-braces: half the known exceptions prove the lexical
//     net cannot see them — membership.validation_mode,
//     storage.database.ssl_mode, credential_delivery.mode,
//     credential_delivery.smtp.tls, notifications.email.tls,
//     server.http.metrics_token and server.http.max_request_body_bytes are
//     all security-weakening in some value, and not one of them contains a word a pattern list would flag. A
//     new field of that kind would sail straight through net 1. Net 2 cannot
//     miss it: ANY added, removed or renamed leaf anywhere in Config fails, and
//     the failure message states the two legitimate ways to resolve it.
//
// What this does NOT claim: that it can tell a weakening setting from a benign
// one by itself. Net 1 guesses from the name and net 2 refuses to guess at all,
// forcing a human classification on every addition. That is the whole design —
// the thing being prevented is a weakening setting entering the codebase with
// NOBODY having looked at it, not a wrong guess about which it is.

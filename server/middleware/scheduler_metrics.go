// scheduler_metrics.go — Prometheus instrumentation for the background schedulers.
//
// The server runs a fleet of periodic schedulers (anomaly detection, retention
// purge, auto-rotation, certificate-expiry scan, …) as goroutines in main. Each was
// previously opaque: a tick that errored only left a log line, so there was no way to
// alert on "scheduler X has not succeeded in an hour" or "tick failure rate is rising".
//
// RecordSchedulerRun folds each tick into Prometheus. Three outcomes are tracked per
// scheduler:
//
//   - success — the tick ran and completed without error.
//   - failure — the tick ran and returned an error (or the advisory-lock acquisition
//     itself failed).
//   - skipped — the tick did not run this round: in an HA deployment another replica
//     holds the single-writer advisory lock (ADR-039), or a per-job guard (e.g. an
//     active legal hold) deliberately stood the job down. A skipped tick is NOT a
//     failure — a follower replica skips most ticks by design and must not page.
//
// The run-count and duration series live on the default Prometheus registry, which the
// server exposes unauthenticated via MetricsHandler at GET /metrics — standard for
// scraping. The two last-run/last-success timestamp gauges are deliberately kept off
// that public registry (see schedulerTimingRegistry below) and are instead served via
// SchedulerMetricsHandler, which the router mounts behind an authenticated route.
//
// Suggested alerts (against the authenticated scheduler-metrics endpoint): page when a
// scheduler stops succeeding —
//
//	time() - keyorix_scheduler_last_success_timestamp_seconds{scheduler="auto_rotation"} > 3600
//
// or on absence (a scheduler that has never once succeeded since boot):
//
//	absent(keyorix_scheduler_last_success_timestamp_seconds{scheduler="auto_rotation"})

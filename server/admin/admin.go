// Package admin implements `keyorix-server admin <cmd>` (ADR-108 §B, PR 11):
// offline, host-side operations that need direct access to the database and
// key files on the server host, run as subcommands of the server binary
// rather than a third binary (the server binary already links core and
// storage). No admin command ever starts an HTTP or gRPC listener.

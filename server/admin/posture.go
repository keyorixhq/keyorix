// collectInsecureSettingsPosture reports EVERY item-2 registry entry currently

//
// The first shape of this function skipped any entry whose Describe contained
// the substring "NEEDS ANDREI" -- the marker the registry uses for a setting
// whose insecure_ rename needs a product decision -- and recorded it as
// uncounted informational instead. That was wrong in two separate ways, and
// the coordinator's review of this PR caught both:
//
//  1. It defeated the report. The marker covered THIRTEEN entries, including
//     encryption-at-rest disabled, database TLS disabled (ssl_mode=disable), a
//     forgeable Shamir KEK commitment, unauthenticated /metrics and
//     log-delivered setup links. An install with encryption at rest switched
//     off printed "No deviations found." and exited 0, and nothing else caught
//     it: collectKeyFileSetPosture early-returns when encryption is off, for
//     the good reason that there is then no key material to check. A report
//     whose one job is answering "does this install match the secure baseline"
//     answered yes for an install storing every secret in plaintext.
//
//  2. The mechanism was unsound regardless of which entries it hit. Keying
//     security control flow on a prose match against a human-readable
//     description string means any future entry whose Describe happens to
//     contain that phrase silently stops counting -- a reviewer editing a
//     sentence could switch off a deviation without touching a line of logic.
//
// The review suggested scoping the exclusion to the defensible shipped-template
// cases via an explicit per-entry registry field. Andrei's instruction is
// stronger, and is what is implemented: every insecure setting counts as a
// deviation, whether or not its naming is settled. So there is no exclusion
// field to key on, and no way to add one by accident.
//
// What a shipped template needs is honesty about WHY, not an exemption, so the
// origin distinction does that job instead: a weakening that is simply the
// current default reads as "shipped-default" and still counts. If a shipped
// config template exits non-zero here, the install genuinely does not match
// the secure baseline, and the fix is to change the default (which is what the
// rest of ADR-112 is for) rather than to stop reporting it.

//     working; it needs no redesign, only the API back.
//  2. report.deviate("break-glass-review", "independent review impossible")
//     when the install has exactly ONE admin-tier holder. This one is a
//     SEPARATE finding, not a detail of the first: with a single admin, every

// drive_sink_test.go — the reporting seam that lets a test DRIVE the fault
// harness for one case without the harness's own verdict terminating that test.
//
// Why this exists. driveFaultCase's whole purpose is to inspect what the oracle
// would see for one (op, method, nth, kind) case. Its doc comment claimed it ran
// the harness "against a throwaway *testing.T-shaped sink so only the
// observation escapes" — but it passed the caller's real *testing.T, and the
// harness calls t.Skipf when the fault-free reference run errors or fails, when
// Setup errors, and t.Fatalf when a snapshot fails. On a *testing.T those are
// not reports, they are control flow: the first one ends the CALLING test.
//
// That broke both staleness checks, in the direction that makes them useless:
//
//   - TestKnownOpenTolerances_AreLoadBearing iterates every tolerance in one
//     test function, so the FIRST row whose reference run happened to skip ended
//     the whole test as SKIP — every row after it unexamined, and a SKIP reads
//     as "nothing to report" in CI.
//   - TestOracleAByDesign_RowsAreLoadBearing runs a subtest per row, and a
//     subtest that SKIPS is not a subtest that passed a check. A row that could
//     not be evaluated came out looking fine.
//
// Both are the "a check that silently skips its own population" shape: green,
// and green for a reason unrelated to the property. So the sink below is real
// now, and "could not be evaluated" is a distinct outcome the callers must
// handle rather than a bool they can conflate with "not applicable".
//
// Design note: Errorf is deliberately NOT an abort. An oracle violation reported
// through Errorf is exactly what these checks are LOOKING for — a tolerance is
// load-bearing precisely because the oracle still flags its case. Recording it
// and continuing is what lets the caller observe that. Skip/Fatal are aborts
// because they mean the iteration produced no observation at all.

//     it has no valid reference state, and a skip that propagated to the real
//     *testing.T is the original bug.

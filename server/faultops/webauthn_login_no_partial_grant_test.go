// webauthn_login_no_partial_grant_test.go — #2841.
//
// A WebAuthn login whose assertion VERIFIES, and which is then reported to the
// caller as failed, must leave no session and no MFA step-up grant behind.
//
// Before this change the session half already held and the grant half did not.
// `completeLogin` (server/http/handlers/auth.go) resolves the response identity
// AFTER core has already minted the session and the grant, and on failure it
// revokes the session — but nothing revoked the grant, so an
// MFAStepUpPurposeRestrictedSecretRead grant outlived a login the caller was
// told had failed, satisfying the restricted-secret MFA gate for the rest of the
// step-up window on some later, unrelated session.
//
// Measured on the pre-fix tree with the faultops repro from #2841
// (op="REST POST /auth/webauthn/login/finish",
// fault=(GetUserRoles, NthCall=1, kind=error)):
//
//	success=false detail="HTTP 500: Login could not be completed. Please try again."
//	diff vs before     = [AuditEvent MFAStepUpGrant LoginAttempt]
//	diff vs fault-free = [Session AuditEvent]
//
// Session is absent from the vs-before diff, which is the proof the existing
// session compensation works; MFAStepUpGrant's presence there is the defect.
//
// This test asserts on the TABLE DIFF rather than on the HTTP status, because a
// partial-state bug reports the same error at every layer either way — only the
// persisted rows distinguish "nothing left behind" from "a grant survived". It
// drives the real REST handler through the real core and storage via the faultops
// harness, so it exercises the actual ordering between the fallible read and the
// writes rather than a reconstruction of it.

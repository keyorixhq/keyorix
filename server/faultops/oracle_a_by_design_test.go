// oracle_a_by_design_test.go — #2549: the acceptable-by-design exemption
// oracle (a)'s error-reporting branch was missing, plus the staleness guard
// that would have caught four of #2549's own tolerances going dead.
//
// What #2549 asked for, and what was actually still missing
// ---------------------------------------------------------
// The issue reports that checkOracles' oracle (a) SUCCESS branch has
// onlyOutcomeLogTables (accept an AuditEvent-only diff unconditionally, safe
// because oracle (c) already ruled out the fail-open authz cause) while "the
// `default:` (error-reporting) branch has no equivalent exemption."
//
// That is no longer true: the error branch grew its own onlyOutcomeLogTables
// check. Driving #2549's two reported instances directly settles which of them
// the gap still affects, and the answer is different for each:
//
//   - BulkRejectAccessRequests / BulkApproveAccessRequests: diff vs the
//     pre-fault state is [AuditEvent] — an outcome-log table. Already accepted
//     by the error branch's onlyOutcomeLogTables, logged ACCEPTABLE-BY-DESIGN,
//     and the oracle never reaches report(). The four knownOpenTolerances that
//     cited #2549 for these were therefore DEAD — never consulted, still
//     carrying a 2026-10-17 expiry that would have produced re-filing churn for
//     a case nothing flags. They are deleted, and
//     TestOracleAErrorBranch_BulkAccessRequestAuditDiffIsAcceptedWithoutATolerance
//     pins what actually covers them so they cannot return as cargo-cult rows.
//   - VerifyMFAStepUp: diff is [MFASecret]. That is BUSINESS state, not an
//     outcome log, so no existing exemption reaches it and the tolerance was
//     genuinely load-bearing. But a tolerance is the wrong instrument: it means
//     "a filed, not-yet-fixed bug, tolerated until someone fixes it", and this
//     is not a bug — VerifyMFAStepUp's own doc comment and
//     TestVerifyMFAStepUp_GrantFailureAfterConsume_FailsClosed both establish
//     "consume the TOTP step first, fail closed if the grant write fails" as the
//     INTENDED design (a replayed code must not become reusable because the
//     grant write failed). Tolerating a by-design behaviour under an expiring
//     bug tolerance guarantees it is re-filed forever.
//
// So the exemption this file adds is narrow by construction and aimed at
// exactly that shape: a reported ERROR that intentionally leaves a
// business-state table mutated, where the mutation IS the security behaviour.
//
// Why not just widen onlyOutcomeLogTables, or add a tables entry to some
// existing map
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   - onlyOutcomeLogTables is deliberately table-based and op-independent. It
//     is safe that way only because an outcome log is, by definition, not
//     application state. MFASecret is application state; accepting it
//     unconditionally for every op would be exactly the blanket skip #2549
//     says not to build.
//   - opScopedBestEffortTables (opScopedAcceptableByDesign) is about a
//     best-effort side effect the code is willing to LOSE. This is the
//     opposite: a mutation the code deliberately KEEPS while reporting failure.
//     Filing it there would make the next reader believe the TOTP consume is
//     discardable, which is the one thing it must not be.
//
// What this mechanism does NOT do, stated explicitly
// --------------------------------------------------
//   - It does not verify its own rows' claims. Each row cites the production
//     doc comment and the unit test that establish the design; those citations
//     are prose and this file does not re-derive them. What it does enforce is
//     that each row HAS them (TestOracleAByDesign_RowsAreFullyAttributed) and
//     that each row still matches something real
//     (TestOracleAByDesign_RowsAreLoadBearing).
//   - It only covers the error-reporting branch's business-state case. The
//     success branch and oracle (d) are untouched.
//   - A row's tables list is an exact allowlist, subset-checked. A diff with
//     even one table outside it still fails loudly.

// instead of either blocking the build or being invisible.
//
// The entry condition is deliberately narrow, because a baselined row is exempt
// from the dead-row check for as long as it sits here. A row belongs here only
// when its issue is OPEN. A dead tolerance whose issue is CLOSED is not debt —
// it is a tolerance for a fixed bug, which actively hides a regression in that
// fix (the oracle would flag the behaviour coming back, and the tolerance would
// absorb it). Those get DELETED from knownOpenTolerances, not baselined:
// #2554, #2599 and #2606 were, each on three independent signals — issue
// CLOSED, the fix's own artefact present in the tree, and this check reporting
// the row dead. See each deletion note in knownOpenTolerances.
//
// What is verified for the rows below: the fault fires, the oracle reports no
// violation, and matchingKnownOpen therefore never returns them. What is NOT
// verified: WHY each went quiet — a tolerance may be dead because an earlier
// accept-by-design now shadows it, in which case the right move is to move it
// to oracleAByDesignErrors with a design citation rather than drop it. That
// per-entry call belongs to the owner of each open issue.
//
// Both ratchets fire on these rows: TestKnownOpenTolerances_AreLoadBearing
// fails if a baselined row's knownOpenTolerance is gone (stale baseline) AND if
// the oracle starts consulting it again (it is live, not debt). The check's own

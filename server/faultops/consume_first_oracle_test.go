// consume_first_oracle_test.go teaches oracle (a)'s ERROR branch the one
// state-change-on-error shape this repository has ALREADY reviewed, classified
// and machine-enforced as correct: docs/atomicity-exempt.tsv class B,
// "consume-first by design -- a single-use value is consumed BEFORE later work
// and must stay consumed even if later work fails (replay protection)".
//
// Why this is a separate file and not another knownOpenTolerances row: a
// tolerance says "a filed, not-yet-fixed finding". These are not findings. The
// functions involved carry their own `// atomicity: consume-first by design`
// marker comment, a class-B row in docs/atomicity-exempt.tsv, and a verifying
// *_FailsClosed test; internal/core/atomicity_guard_test.go already fails the
// build if either stops being classified. Oracle (a) was the only mechanism in
// the repo that did not know about that ledger, so it read a deliberately
// RETAINED consumption as a partial commit -- and because the consumption
// happens before ANY faulted call, every storage method on the op reproduces
// it, which is why per-(method, nth) tolerances for this shape grow without
// ever converging (see #2549's four bulk-approve rows for the same treadmill).
//
// WHAT THIS VERIFIES. For an op with an entry below, and only on a reported
// ERROR, that the ONLY difference between this run's OWN before and after
// state is the declared consumption:
//   - consumedColumns: the named columns of the named tables, and
//   - consumedByDeletion: the named tables, and then only under a PURE ROW
//     SUBTRACTION -- rows may disappear, but a row that was ADDED or EDITED
//     makes the exemption refuse.
//
// Every other table and column must be byte-identical to this run's own
// pre-fault state. If anything else moved, the oracle still fails. That is the
// load-bearing property: it is NOT "class B functions may leave state behind",
// which would mask a genuine partial commit inside the same function.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT VERIFY, stated explicitly per CLAUDE.md:
//   - Audit content. outcomeLogTables (AuditEvent/SecretAccessLog/Notification)
//     are excluded from the comparison, on the SAME reasoning the (a) SUCCESS
//     branch's onlyOutcomeLogTables already states: oracle (c) runs first and
//     would have caught a fail-open-authz cause before execution reaches here.
//     A wrong audit *message* on a consume-first error path is invisible here.
//   - Whether the consume-first design is the right design. It takes
//     docs/atomicity-exempt.tsv's class-B classification as given, and
//     TestConsumeFirstExemptions_MatchAtomicityLedger refuses any entry whose
//     function the ledger does not classify B -- so this list cannot drift
//     into blessing a function nobody reviewed, but it also does not re-derive
//     that review.
//   - The SUCCESS branch. A reported success is compared against the
//     fault-free REFERENCE run, a different question; this exemption is
//     deliberately error-branch-only.

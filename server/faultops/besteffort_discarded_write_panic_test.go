// besteffort_discarded_write_panic_test.go — regression pins for a post-commit
// best-effort write whose result was discarded with a bare `_ =`.
//
// `_ =` drops a returned error but not a PANIC. Each tuple below is a storage
// write that runs AFTER the operation's own commit; a panic in it escaped the
// discard, the transport's recovery turned it into a 500 / codes.Internal, and
// the caller was told an operation failed that had in fact committed:
//
//   - GRPC UserService.CreateUser, AddPasswordHistory#1/panic: the user and its
//     role grants exist ([User UserRole]) while the RPC reported Internal.
//     Found by CI's fuzz shard 2 on #2876; reproduces on origin/main.
//   - change-password, PrunePasswordHistory#1/panic: the password change is
//     committed while the request reported 500 — and the PAT/session
//     revocation that follows it in ChangePassword never ran.
//   - SAML ACS, UpdateLastLogin#1/panic: a live Session was minted while the
//     ACS reported 500 (the #2841 shape on the SSO path).
//
// The class guard is internal/besteffortguard (scan.go): a write whose own
// result is blank-discarded no longer counts as the "last write", so such a
// discard is now itself flagged when nothing checked follows it. These
// fuzz-level pins assert the EFFECT end to end, through the real harness.

// g80_triage_doc_closure_guard_test.go — Task 0b's guard: a "FIXED" claim in
// the G80 triage docs (docs/g80-raw-storage-bypass-triage.md,
// docs/g80-documented-exception-sweep-findings.md) that references a PR
// number is not itself evidence the fix reached `main` — see this session's
// own headline finding: PRs #1563-#1566 all showed "Merged" on GitHub while
// each was actually merged into the PREVIOUS PR's feature branch, never
// `main` (CLAUDE.md's "a merge badge is not a merge").
//
// IMPORTANT scope note (corrected 2026-08-25, see CLAUDE.md's fuller
// correction): `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> HEAD` is sound HERE
// because every claim below names one specific, already-resolved commit SHA
// -- checking whether a known object is included in HEAD's history is a
// valid question regardless of squash-merge. It would NOT be sound to run
// `--is-ancestor <branch-tip> origin/main` instead: this repo squash-merges
// every PR, minting a brand-new commit, so a correctly-landed branch's own
// pre-squash commits are never ancestors of that squash commit either --
// that check returns false unconditionally, landed or not. This guard never
// does that; it only ever checks named, resolved SHAs, never a branch ref.
//
// This is NOT a claim that every referenced commit fixes what it says it
// fixes -- that's the triage doc's own job. This guard only checks the
// narrower, mechanical fact a merge badge cannot be trusted to report:
// is the commit actually reachable from HEAD.
//
// Entries with no single commit to point at (the #1563-#1566 + ADR-085
// content, re-applied as one flat diff onto a fresh branch rather than
// individually-attributable commits -- see this file's own registry entry
// below for the full reasoning) are listed explicitly with a stated reason,
// not silently exempted from this file's registry -- a missing entry would
// look identical to "nothing more to verify," which is exactly the kind of
// silent gap this guard exists to prevent.

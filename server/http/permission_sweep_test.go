// permission_sweep_test.go — the CP-001/CP-008 disclosure-family guard, structural
// counterpart to deployment_disclosure_family_test.go's behavioral regression tests.
//
// admin_usage.go and admin_billing.go were the 7th+ confirmed instance of the same
// mistake: gating a deployment-wide, cross-project/cross-user disclosure report on
// system.read (RequirePermission(permSystemRead) or
// RequireScopedPermission(permSystemRead, ...)) in server/http/router.go, when
// system.read is the universal system_viewer baseline auto-assigned to every user at
// creation (CreateUser), every SSO/JIT-provisioned user, and every SCIM-provisioned
// user — see control_framework.go, compliance_posture.go, deployment_hygiene.go,
// machine_token_hygiene.go, pat_hygiene.go, secrets_name_conformance_deployment.go,
// dashboard.go, admin_usage.go, and admin_billing.go's own header comments for the
// full list of prior instances.
//
// This is an AST sweep over server/http/router.go's source text (not the compiled
// package — the point is to catch a regression in the router WIRING itself, before
// any test that spins up the router even runs), asserting that every
// RequirePermission(permSystemRead)/RequireScopedPermission(permSystemRead, ...) call
// site found is explicitly reviewed and justified in the allowlist below. Mirrors
// internal/cli/writeguard's allowlist-with-reasoning convention: a call site the sweep
// finds must either not exist (gated on something stronger instead) or be justified
// here with a written reason, not just a line number. An empty justification, or an
// allowlist entry whose call site the sweep can no longer find, fails the test — see
// TestPermissionSweepAllowlistJustificationsAreNonEmpty and
// TestPermissionSweepAllowlistEntriesStillExist below.
//
// Verified RED against a reverted admin_usage.go/admin_billing.go fix (both routes
// put back on permSystemRead) — TestNoUnjustifiedSystemReadOnlyGates failed with both
// call sites reported as unallowed; GREEN once the fix (audit.read) was restored.
//
// Allowlist keys are ROUTE IDENTITY ("<HTTP METHOD> <full chi-mounted path>", e.g.
// "GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats"), never a source line number. router.go:LINE keys
// were the original design and broke on every PR that inserted or deleted lines
// anywhere earlier in the file: every later allowlist entry silently pointed at the
// wrong call site (or none), so TestNoUnjustifiedSystemReadOnlyGates/
// TestNoUngatedRoutes failed on PRs that never touched the routes in question — a
// stale justification could also silently attach to a different route entirely if
// the line shift happened to land on another gate call. A route's mounted path does
// not move when unrelated lines shift, so scanRouter (below) resolves the FULL
// mounted path for every route-registration call in NewRouter by walking chi's
// r.Route(...)/r.Group(...) nesting and accumulating each level's literal or
// const-resolvable path segment, exactly mirroring how chi itself builds the mount
// tree at startup. A permission gate applied at a group's own r.Use(...) — covering
// every route beneath it, not one specific route — is keyed "USE <group path>"
// instead of a method+path, since it is not owned by any single leaf route.

// Broader guard: every registered route must have SOME permission check, not

// cover: a route added with NO RequirePermission/RequireScopedPermission/
// RequireScopedSecretPermission/RequireScopedSecretRefPermission call anywhere
// in its middleware chain -- neither directly on the route nor via r.Use() at
// an enclosing r.Route(...)/r.Group(...) group level -- is a strictly WORSE
// version of the same under-gating shape admin_usage.go/admin_billing.go had
// (gated on nothing beats gated on a universal baseline), and nothing caught
// it before this.
//
// This does NOT replace TestNoUnjustifiedSystemReadOnlyGates above: that sweep
// catches a route gated on SOME permission that turns out to be baseline-
// equivalent (looks administrative, is actually granted to everyone); this one
// only catches a route gated on NO permission at all. A route solely on
// permSystemRead has a non-empty middleware chain, so this broader check sees
// "some permission check present" and passes it through silently -- it would
// NOT have caught the admin_usage.go/admin_billing.go bug this file was
// originally written for. The two checks are complementary, not redundant;
// both run.
//
// Scope: this scanner walks only the NewRouter function's own body (found by
// name in the parsed AST), not the whole file. registerWebUI (this file's
// other route-registering function) wires the SPA's static-asset host
// (/assets/*, /static/*, /sw.js, /manifest.json, /favicon.ico) and the
// client-side-routing NotFound fallback through its own serveStatic closure
// (`rr := r.With(mws...)`), an indirection this AST sweep does not attempt to
// resolve. Those routes serve pre-built, non-per-tenant static files (JS/CSS/
// HTML shell) with no permission concept -- the same public-by-design
// category as /health, /readyz, and /status -- and are out of scope by
// construction rather than silently passed.
//
// Recognizes two things as "some permission check applies", beyond the four
// literal middleware names:
//   - customMiddleware.SCIMToken(...) applied via r.Use() on the /scim/v2
//     group: RFC 7644 SCIM provisioning's own authentication+authorization
//     mechanism is a static shared-secret bearer token, not a per-user RBAC
//     permission grant -- there is no "permission" to check for a machine
//     credential that IS the authorization boundary by design. Every route
//     under /scim/v2 inherits this group-level gate; without recognizing it,
//     all twelve SCIM routes would need individually-repeated allowlist
//     entries pointing at the same one architectural fact.
//   - Group-level r.Use(...) middleware, exactly like the existing sweep's
//     ANOMALY-04 handling of GET /audit/anomalies (router.go:1062 in the
//     allowlist above): chi's With() on a route registered inside a group
//     ADDS to, never replaces, the group's own Use() middleware, and a
//     group's Use() middleware wraps every route dispatched through that
//     group's Mux -- inline or registered via a nested r.Route/r.Group --
//     because the wrapping happens in the Mux's own handler chain before
//     dispatch, not per individual route registration. This sweep reuses
//     that exact reasoning generically: it walks router.go's nesting
//     (r.Route/r.Group closures, and r.Use(...) calls found textually within
//     each) and computes, for every route-registration call
//     (Get/Post/Put/Delete/Patch/Head/Options/Connect/Trace/Handle/Mount),
//     the union of (a) every enclosing group's Use() middleware, walking
//     outward, and (b) every .With(...) call chained directly onto that one
//     route (including a multi-link chain like
//     .With(a).With(b).Post(...), collected by walking the CallExpr's
//     receiver chain back to its base). A route with an empty union in

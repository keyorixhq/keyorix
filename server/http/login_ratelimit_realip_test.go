// login_ratelimit_realip_test.go — regression coverage for HARDENING-BACKLOG #301:
// the global RealIP-style client-IP derivation must NOT let an unauthenticated caller
// spoof its rate-limit identity via X-Forwarded-For / X-Real-IP, unless the request
// actually arrived through an operator-configured trusted reverse proxy.
//
// Login() (server/http/handlers/auth.go) keys the ADR-040 failed-login budget
// (core.LoginMaxAttempts = 10 per core.LoginWindow) on r.RemoteAddr, which by the
// time it reaches the handler has already passed through the router's client-IP
// middleware (server/http/router.go → server/middleware/client_ip.go). Before that
// middleware existed, the router installed chi's stock middleware.RealIP, which
// substitutes ANY caller-supplied forwarding header into r.RemoteAddr unconditionally
// — letting an attacker either (a) bypass the throttle entirely by incrementing a
// fake X-Forwarded-For per attempt, or (b) lock out a victim's real IP by replaying
// failed logins with their address in X-Forwarded-For.

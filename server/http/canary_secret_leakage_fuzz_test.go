// canary_secret_leakage_fuzz_test.go — FuzzCanarySecretLeakage.
//
// Keyorix's core promise: a secret value never appears anywhere it shouldn't. This
// fuzzer plants unique canary values — for Secret VALUES (regenerated every
// iteration), and once per world for Personal Access Tokens, a session/login token,
// a dynamic-secret admin DSN, a dynamic-secret issued lease credential, and an MFA
// enrollment secret — and drives a fuzzed sequence of hostile operations
// (cross-project reads, malformed/oversized/wrong-content-type requests, rotation,
// version reads, deletes, audit queries, list/export endpoints) through the REAL,
// fully-wired stack — the actual chi router + auth middleware + handlers + core +
// crypto + storage, PLUS the real gRPC server over bufconn — and scans EVERY
// reachable output channel for every canary after every op and at sequence end.
//
// PERFORMANCE: cost-independent-of-history-size scanning. An earlier version of this
// file scanned each output against every encoded variant of every canary ever
// planted (a list that grows every iteration) — the same per-input decay observed in
// FuzzGRPCRESTSecretReadAuthzParity. Two changes fix that:
//
//  1. Secret-VALUE-family canaries (secretA/B, the mutation-lifecycle probe's
//     throwaway values, the dynamic-secret DSN/lease canaries) all share one fixed
//     shape: deriveCanary's "kxcanary-" + 32 lowercase hex chars. Instead of
//     checking each output against N known values, every scan does a CONSTANT number
//     of passes over the output — one for the literal "kxcanary-" prefix (raw form,
//     which also covers JSON/URL-escaped since this charset needs no escaping), one
//     each for its hex encoding (lower/upper), and one each for its alignment-
//     independent base64 middle-pattern (3 phase alignments × std/url = 6) — extracts
//     the fixed-length candidate token that follows, and looks it up in a
//     map[string]struct{} (O(1) regardless of how many canaries have been planted).
//     An unrecognized-but-canary-shaped token is treated exactly like a recognized
//     one: both fail (see scanCanaryLeaks). Base64/hex hits fail on pattern match
//     alone without attempting offset-aware decode-back-to-source — no legitimate
//     channel in this codebase ever base64/hex-encodes a secret value, so a match is
//     already sufficient evidence; recovering exactly which canary leaked via a
//     base64 hit would require materially more machinery (tracking the actual
//     encoding run's start offset) for no gain in detection power. See
//     scanCanaryLeaks's doc comment for the full account.
//  2. PAT / session / MFA-enrollment secrets don't share that prefix (a raw PAT
//     token, an opaque session token, and a base32 TOTP secret are each a different,
//     system-generated shape) and are comparatively expensive to mint (PAT creation,
//     bcrypt-backed login, MFA enrollment). These are now planted ONCE per world
//     (buildCanaryWorld), not once per input — cross-input tracking still checks
//     them on every later input (a fixed, small set of ~3 literal values + their
//     encodings, itself O(1) regardless of iteration count), it just doesn't keep
//     re-minting new ones. The dynamic-secret admin DSN, its issued lease
//     credential, and the known-open webhook-URL probe (see below) moved to
//     world-build time for the same reason — real per-call cost (a DB write, or for
//     the webhook case, the audit-diff introspection query), not scan cost, was the
//     concern there.
//
// Oracle (exact-match, no heuristics): a Secret-VALUE-family canary may appear ONLY
// in the JSON response body of one of three designated, permission-checked
// value-disclosure calls — HTTP GET /secrets/value?ref=, HTTP GET
// /secrets/{id}?include_value=true, gRPC SecretService.GetSecretValue — made by a
// principal the live shadow-grant model says currently holds read access to THAT
// EXACT secret (or is admin), and even then only in the `value` field, never
// alongside any OTHER canary ever planted. PAT/session/MFA/DSN/lease are all
// generated and consumed via direct in-process core calls, so their sole
// "authorized channel" is the Go return value itself — nothing to special-case in
// the scanners; from the moment each is planted it is zero-tolerance everywhere this
// harness looks (DB, logs, every HTTP/gRPC response). This is also a genuine, useful
// assertion for two of them: PAT tokens and session tokens are stored in the DB only
// as a SHA-256 hash (see TokenHash / Session.SessionToken's doc comments), so
// scanning the DB for the RAW value additionally confirms that hashing property
// live, not just secret-value encryption.
//
// KNOWN-OPEN EXCEPTION: NotificationChannel.URL (the webhook/Slack/Teams bearer
// credential — internal/notifychan/delivery.go's own comment: "the destination URL
// IS the bearer credential") is CONFIRMED, on this branch, to leak into
// audit_events.Diff via internal/core/config_change_audit.go's
// writeConfigChangeAuditEvent, which json.Marshals the full NotificationChannel
// struct (internal/core/notification_channels.go:65-68 on create; :108,:126 on
// update/delete). See keyorix-private/adversarial-review/
// NOTIFICATION-CHANNEL-URL-AUDIT-DIFF-LEAK-2026-09-19.md (private repo, not in this
// tree) for the full trace, who-can-read analysis, and fix options. buildCanaryWorld
// creates ONE webhook channel with a canary URL and confirms the leak ONCE via
// f.Logf (not t.Fatalf) — informational, not gating, and not repeated on every
// input (re-confirming a known, unfixed, single-cause bug on every iteration adds
// cost for no new information). The webhook canary is never added to the shared
// knownCanaries map, so it plays no further part in any later scan.
// TODO(NOTIFICATION-CHANNEL-URL-AUDIT-DIFF-LEAK-2026-09-19): once fixed, delete this
// paragraph and the special-cased block in buildCanaryWorld, and fold the webhook
// canary into the normal plant() flow.
//
// Every reachable output channel is captured in-process: stdlib `log` (the sole
// logger in this codebase, redirected to a buffer), every other HTTP response body/
// header (list, versions, diff, access-log export, audit search/export, inventory
// CSV, metrics, health, every mutation response), every gRPC response/error/
// metadata/trailer, the full SQLite schema (every table, every column, introspected
// — not hand-enumerated, so a table this file's author didn't think of is still
// covered), and the raw on-disk SQLite file bytes.
//
// Audit rows are written asynchronously (goSafe, detached context). Rather than a
// fixed sleep before scanning (which can race a slow write and silently miss a real
// leak), server/http/handlers, server/grpc/services, and internal/core each expose a
// DrainBackgroundGoroutines() test hook — a WaitGroup tracking every goSafe dispatch
// — that this fuzzer calls to deterministically wait for every in-flight background
// write to land before the DB/raw-file scan.
//
// REPRODUCIBILITY GATE: this world is long-lived and shares state across fuzz
// iterations by design (knownCanaries, dbWatermarks, the DB itself -- see the
// PERFORMANCE section) via the rebuild-every-N mechanism below. That means a
// failure a -fuzz burst finds can depend on accumulated state from MANY prior
// iterations in the same worker process, not just the one input Go saves to
// testdata/fuzz/FuzzCanarySecretLeakage/<hash>. Before reporting ANY
// burst-discovered failure as a finding:
//  1. Note the saved corpus file's hash from the "Failing input written to ..."
//     line (or the seed/# name, if it fired on a seed).
//  2. Re-run ONLY that one input, isolated, on a fresh world:
//     go test -run 'FuzzCanarySecretLeakage/<hash-or-seed-name>' -v
//     (this is a fresh OS process -- buildCanaryWorld runs once, then only the
//     named input executes, nothing else first).
//  3. If it fails again: genuine, state-independent finding -- report normally.
//  4. If it PASSES: state-dependent. Do NOT report it as a plain crasher (Go's
//     corpus file only records the one input that was executing when the
//     failure fired, not the sequence of prior iterations in that same
//     long-lived process that built up the state it needed -- that sequence is
//     not recoverable from the saved file alone). Instead report: (a) that it
//     is confirmed state-dependent via this exact isolation step, (b) whatever
//     can be determined about what state it needs (e.g. from the channel/table
//     it fired on, or by deliberately reproducing the accumulation), and (c) if
//     the causing sequence genuinely cannot be identified, say so explicitly
//     rather than fabricating one. A state-dependent corpus file must not be
//     committed as a regression entry -- go test -run FuzzXxx replays every
//     testdata file AND every seed in one shared process, so whether such a
//     file fails would depend on file-discovery order, making it flaky rather
//     than a real regression check.
// Worked example (2026-09, this round): a burst found a raw-file failure on a
// bare "kxcanary-" fragment (zero informative trailing bytes -- pure SQLite
// page-slack noise after the shared literal prefix) that reproduced only inside
// a long-running burst, never when its saved corpus file was replayed alone --
// confirmed state-dependent via this exact procedure, and NOT committed as a
// testdata regression file for that reason. A second, synthetic check (item 2's
// own red-proof: a second webhook canary planted at WORLD-BUILD time, not
// accumulated) confirmed the opposite as a positive control -- that one
// reproduces identically whether replayed inside a full run or in isolation,
// because nothing about its failure depends on prior iterations.
//
// See docs/findings/ for any confirmed leak this harness's red-proofs or live runs
// surface in the public repo, keyorix-private/adversarial-review/ for the private
// finding above, and scripts/fuzzing/targets.conf for this target's soak tier.

//     exempted (the authorized read's own legitimately-disclosed value — see
//     checkValueEndpoint). Any OTHER candidate fails, whether it's in `known` (a
//     historical/cross-input leak) or not (an unrecognized-but-canary-shaped token —
//     could be a tracking gap in this harness itself, but is exactly as much a
//     finding either way, so it fails the same). A prefix match with insufficient
//     trailing bytes, or trailing bytes that aren't all hex digits, also fails
//     (malformed/truncated is still suspicious, never silently ignored).
//   - Hex-encoded form: same extract-and-classify, via hexEncodedCandidateAt.
//   - Base64 form (any of 3 phase alignments, std/url): pattern match alone fails —
//     no legitimate channel in this codebase ever base64-encodes a secret value, so
//     recovering exactly which canary leaked isn't needed to know it's a leak.
//   - fixedCreds (PAT/session/MFA): a small, constant-size direct Contains check per
//     precomputed variant.
//
// exemptions is a small, standing set of (value, channel) exceptions that must
// NEVER fail here -- checked in addition to `allowed` -- unlike `allowed` (one
// call's own legitimate disclosure), an exemption is permanent for every call whose
// channel matches its channelPrefix. Its only use in this file is the known-open
// webhook-URL-into-audit-diff finding (see the file header): the webhook canary
// shares canaryPrefix's shape, so without this it would be flagged as an
// "unknown/unrecognized" token on every scan of an affected channel for the rest of
// the run. A DIFFERENT canary value is never exempted just because it lands on the
// same channel, and this SAME value is never exempted on a channel not listed. Pass
// nil for channels where no such standing exception exists (most of them).
//
// rawFileChannel is the one channel in this file that scans UNSTRUCTURED bytes
// spanning SQLite page/B-tree-internal structure and (confirmed live, twice, during
// burst runs) freed-page slack from a row that physically relocated -- a canary's own
// bytes interrupted by binary garbage at an unpredictable, sometimes very short,
// offset. This is the ONLY reason a truncated/malformed prefix match is EVER treated
// as anything other than an immediate finding: matchesAcceptedPartial's ambiguity
// check (see its own doc comment) can positively confirm a fragment is an
// already-accepted value's own bytes, cut short -- and ONLY that confirmed case is
// skipped silently, since it is definitionally the same artifact already accounted
// for, not a new one. A fragment matchesAcceptedPartial does NOT
// confirm -- because it is ambiguous between two or more live canaries/exemptions, or
// because it matches none of them -- is FATAL on this channel exactly like every
// other channel; there is no separate, broader leniency for rawFileChannel on top of
// that check (see TestScanCanaryLeaks_AmbiguousRawFileFragmentFailsClosed, added
// after a bug of exactly this shape was found: an earlier version of this file
// downgraded EVERY unattributable fragment on this channel regardless of
// matchesAcceptedPartial's verdict, which silently accepted genuinely ambiguous
// fragments too). A COMPLETE, well-formed match on db:raw-file (the exemptedFull /

// this deadlock the first time a DB-scan leak actually fired.
//
// INCREMENTAL, via watermarks: without this, "SELECT * FROM tbl" re-reads and

// "https://example.com/hooks/" -- the ALREADY-EXEMPTED webhook canary's own URL,
// forensically unambiguous (that literal URL prefix occurs nowhere else in this
// file) -- fragmented by ordinary SQLite page churn down to nothing but the marker.
// Every occurrence was confirmed state-dependent (does not reproduce on a fresh
// world alone -- see the file header's REPRODUCIBILITY GATE section) and NOT
// committed as a testdata regression file for that reason; this synthetic,
// deterministic test is what actually proves the fix, not a saved corpus file that

// buildCanaryWorld stands up the real production stack once per fuzz worker PROCESS
// (Go's native fuzzer runs each -fuzz worker as a separate OS process; within one
// process, f.Fuzz iterations run sequentially on one goroutine, so buildCanaryWorld's
// single shared world is never touched by two iterations concurrently -- only by the
// occasional goSafe background goroutine, which is why logBuf needs its own mutex).
//
// Unlike the sibling fuzz harnesses in this package, this world is FILE-backed SQLite
// (not :memory:) -- the RULES require scanning the raw on-disk file, which is only
// meaningful for a real file -- and wires BOTH secret-value and auth-secret
// encryptors (SetSecretValueEncryptor / SetAuthEncryptor), so the plaintext-at-rest
// assertion is live for secret values, MFA secrets, and dynamic-secret DSNs/leases
// alike, not vacuous. A fake dynamic-secret engine (dynamic.FakeEngine, the same one
// internal/core's own tests use) is injected so lease issuance works without a real
// Postgres/MySQL target -- FakeEngine.IssueFields lets a test-chosen canary become
// the issued credential.
//
// PAT / session / MFA / dynamic-secret DSN+lease / the known-open webhook probe are
// all planted HERE, once, not per fuzz input -- see the file header's PERFORMANCE
// section for why.
// worldBuilderTB is the minimal interface buildCanaryWorld needs -- satisfied by
// both *testing.F (the initial, pre-Fuzz build) and *testing.T (a rebuild from
// INSIDE the fuzz target; see the PERFORMANCE section's rebuild-every-N mechanism).
// Deliberately excludes TempDir/Cleanup: Go's testing package panics if F.Helper (or
// any other *testing.F method) is called from inside the fuzz target ("testing:
// f.Helper was called inside the fuzz target, use t.Helper instead") -- confirmed
// live the first time the rebuild mechanism actually ran. buildCanaryWorld manages
// its own temp directory via os.MkdirTemp instead of TempDir() for exactly this
// reason -- see tempDir below and canaryWorld.close().

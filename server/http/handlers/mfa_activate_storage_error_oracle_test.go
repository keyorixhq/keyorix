// mfa_activate_storage_error_oracle_test.go — the blocking half of #2846,
// which is a review finding against #2744's own fix in this same branch.
//
// #2744 split ActivateMFA's two indistinguishable outcomes apart: a wrong code
// (audited mfa.failed) and a MarkTOTPStepUsed STORAGE failure (now audited
// mfa.error). That is the right split for the AUDIT, and the wrong one for the
// CLIENT: the storage branch returned a plain wrapped sentinel, which
// writeMFAErr renders with clientSafe()'s generic internal-error message, while
// the wrong-code branch returns "invalid code". MarkTOTPStepUsed is reached only
// AFTER validateTOTPStep succeeded, so the two different bodies tell the caller
// whether the code they submitted was CORRECT — a right-vs-wrong-code oracle
// available for as long as the DB fault lasts, which is exactly the
// over-correction #2744's own PR body named as this class's main risk and then
// shipped anyway.
//
// This is a HANDLER-level test on purpose. The leak is not visible in core: the
// two branches there legitimately return different error VALUES (they must, so
// the audit can distinguish them), and a core-level test asserting that would
// pass in both the leaking and the fixed world. Only the rendered HTTP response
// — the thing the caller actually observes — can tell them apart. Same shape as
// "assert the effect, not the return value" in CLAUDE.md.
//
// It asserts byte-identity of the whole response, not just the message field,
// so a future divergence in status, error type, content-type or any added field
// (a request id, a retry hint, a details object on one branch only) fails here
// too. The one thing it deliberately does NOT claim to cover is timing: both
// branches return immediately after their audit call, but nothing in this test
// would catch a latency difference, and a latency oracle is a real variant of
// this finding. Stated rather than silently skipped.

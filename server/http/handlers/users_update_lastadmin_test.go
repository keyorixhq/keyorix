// users_update_lastadmin_test.go — the last-install-admin refusal at the HTTP
// boundary, retargeted onto the route where it is actually reachable (#2496).
//
// HISTORY, because this file's subject moved and the reason matters
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
// ADR-108 PR 6 added TestUpdateUser_RefusesLastAdminDeactivation_RealServer:
// UserHandler.UpdateUser's error switch had no case for
// guardLastAdminDeactivation's refusal, so deactivating the install's sole admin
// via PUT /api/v1/users/{id} returned a bare 500 instead of the readable 409 its
// DeleteUser sibling already produced.
//
// Reaching that guard without self-action needed an actor who passed
// requireAdminRankCeilingForTarget WITHOUT being counted as an admin by
// guardLastAdminDeactivation's resolveGlobalAdminHolders — and that test's own
// doc comment named how: "these use two different definitions of 'admin' (any
// role with BypassesPermissionChecks=true, vs. the fixed installAdminRoleNames
// list)". It built an actor holding a bypass-flagged role named outside the
// fixed list, which the ceiling honoured and the holder count could not see.
//
// #2496 removed that divergence: both now resolve from the structural
// bypasses_permission_checks flag. The fixture's vehicle is gone, and with it
// the reachability of UpdateUser's own 409 case — see
// TestUpdateUser_CeilingAlreadyGuaranteesASurvivingAdminHolder below, which
// asserts the precondition that makes it unreachable rather than leaving that
// as a claim in a comment (#1494's precedent: guard the condition, not the
// conclusion).
//
// The old test is NOT simply deleted, and its assertion was NOT loosened to
// match the new behaviour. What it actually protected — "an operator who tries
// to deactivate the install's last administrator gets a readable refusal, not a
// bare 500" — is preserved, moved to the route where the guard genuinely fires:
// POST /api/v1/users/{id}/suspend, which runs through accountStateAction and
// applies NO admin-rank ceiling (only a self-action check). That route was
// missing the 409 mapping entirely, so it had the exact defect ADR-108 PR 6
// fixed for UpdateUser; this change adds it and tests it.
//
// Why the 200 on the old fixture is correct, not a regression
// -----------------------------------------------------------
// In that fixture the acting user holds a bypass-flagged role at GLOBAL scope.
// Under ADR-084 the bypass applies at whatever scope the role is held, so that
// actor can exercise any permission install-wide — they ARE an install
// administrator, and the install retains one after the target is deactivated.
// TestUpdateUser_DeactivatingAnAdminIsSafeWhileAnotherAdminSurvives below does
// not take that on trust: it authorizes the survivor for users.write /
// roles.assign / system.write and then has them actually create a user. The old
// 409 was the over-refusal direction #2496's PR documents — the guard refusing
// because the name list could not see a real administrator.

//     ErrInsufficientAdminAuthority (403) BEFORE the guard is ever consulted.
//  2. An actor that DOES bypass at global scope is, by #2496's single authority,
//     exactly what resolveGlobalAdminHolders counts as a global-admin holder —
//     so it survives the target's deactivation and the guard finds a holder.
//
// Together: no actor can both reach UpdateUser's guard and leave zero holders.
// The 409 case is kept in the handler regardless (it costs nothing and becomes
// live again if either half changes), but the REACHABLE route's coverage lives

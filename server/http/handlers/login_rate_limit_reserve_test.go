// login_rate_limit_reserve_test.go — F2 (2026-09-20) regression: the per-IP
// login-attempt budget (core.LoginMaxAttempts) used to be enforced by
// checking the count, then only recording an attempt AFTER the slow
// credential check (bcrypt/TOTP/WebAuthn assertion) completed, and only on
// failure. A burst of concurrent requests from one IP all observed the SAME
// under-budget count at their check (none of the others had recorded yet),
// all proceeded through the slow verification, and only then recorded —
// letting the burst blow through the budget before the counter ever caught
// up. The fix moves the record (reserveLoginAttempt) to run BEFORE the slow
// step, right after the request is minimally well-formed (decoded), so
// concurrent requests compete for the same reserved slots instead of each
// reading a stale count.
//
// This is inherently a timing-sensitive property — a maximally-synchronized
// concurrent burst can still theoretically race the check-then-reserve pair
// itself (check and reserve are still two separate calls, not one atomic
// operation; see core's own TestConcurrency_LoginRateLimit_TripsAndStaysTripped
// doc, which explicitly does not promise "at most N ever pass" for the raw
// primitives) — a single 30-request round's too-many-requests count varied
// widely run to run in manual testing (pre-fix: 0-9 of 30; post-fix: 8-20 of
// 30 — real signal, but noisy enough for a single round to flake either way
// in CI). Aggregating several independent rounds averages out that
// per-round scheduling noise (each round uses a fresh IP so no round's
// budget carries into the next) while preserving the real distinction: the
// fix changes the SIZE of the exploitable window from "however long the
// slow credential check takes" (bcrypt, deliberately ~tens of
// milliseconds) down to "however long decode takes" (sub-millisecond).

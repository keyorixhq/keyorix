// readiness.go — ReadinessCheck: a real readiness probe that verifies the server can
// actually serve traffic by pinging its database (core.HealthCheck → SELECT 1). It
// returns 200 when ready and 503 when a dependency is down, so a Kubernetes readiness
// probe stops routing traffic to a replica whose database is unreachable. This is
// distinct from /health (HealthCheck), which is a lightweight liveness signal that must
// NOT depend on the database — a transient DB blip should not restart the pod.

// be rejected outright with a rate-limit error — a readiness probe that starts
// reporting "too many requests" instead of the real DB status would make
// Kubernetes wrongly conclude a healthy replica is unready, a self-inflicted
// outage strictly worse than the DB-load DoS this closes. Caching the last
// real result for a short window instead means a flood reuses that result
// (bounding DB round trips) while still reflecting reality well within any
// realistic orchestrator probe interval (Kubernetes' own default is 10s).

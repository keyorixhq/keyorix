// login_rate_limit_reserve_interleaving_test.go — #2816: a DETERMINISTIC test
// of the property TestLogin_ConcurrentBurst_RateLimitBoundsCredentialChecks
// (login_rate_limit_reserve_test.go) only ever tested statistically.
//
// THE PROPERTY. F2 (2026-09-20): every unauthenticated endpoint used to check
// the per-IP login-attempt budget, run the slow credential check
// (bcrypt/TOTP/WebAuthn assertion), and record the attempt only AFTERWARD, and
// only on failure. Since the check and the record straddled the slow step, a
// burst from one IP all read the same under-budget count and all proceeded.
// The fix moves the record (reserveLoginAttempt) BEFORE the slow step, so the
// budget is consumed at ADMISSION time rather than at verdict time.
//
// WHY THE EXISTING TEST FLAKES. It fires 5 rounds x 30 maximally-synchronized
// requests and asserts the AGGREGATE 429 count clears 40. That is a
// statistical proxy: whether a given request in the burst is refused depends on
// how the Go scheduler and the SQLite-backed reserve interleave with bcrypt,
// which under CI load shifts enough to miss the threshold (#2816 records 38
// observed against a threshold of 40). Its own file header says as much
// ("inherently a timing-sensitive property", "noisy enough for a single round
// to flake either way in CI"), and it is already skipped entirely under -race
// for the same reason.
//
// THE THRESHOLD IS NOT LOWERED, HERE OR THERE. This test does not weaken, relax
// or replace that assertion -- it tests the same property by CONSTRUCTION
// instead of by sampling, which makes the threshold irrelevant rather than
// negotiable. The ordering is observed directly: one login request is PARKED
// inside its credential check, and while it is parked -- with not one
// credential check in the process having completed -- the budget is observed to
// have already been consumed. Under the pre-fix ordering nothing is reserved at
// that moment, so both assertions below fail. There is no sampling, no sleep,
// and no scheduler assumption: every wait is a rendezvous on a channel the
// parked call itself signals, and each is bounded so a regression fails loudly
// instead of hanging the package (CLAUDE.md: bound every wait, or a correctly-
// serialized pair hangs the binary).
//
// It also runs under -race, unlike the burst test.

// ever runs the package unsharded. A process-global completeness check would
// spuriously fail in 3 of every 4 shards, since any one exercising test
// lands in exactly one shard's process. To stay correct under that split
// without adding new CI wiring, this checks each enforced operation's known
// exercising test name(s) (exercisingTests, registry.go) against the
// CURRENT go test -run pattern -- the same regexp ci.yml already computed
// for this shard, read via the standard test.run flag. An operation whose
// exercising test isn't selected in this shard is skipped here, not failed
// (it will be checked when that test's shard runs); one whose test WAS
// eligible but still didn't record an exercise is a real failure.
//
// See ADR-074, "Coverage assertion: enforced must mean exercised".

// invokes any Test function (m.Run() just prints matching names and
// returns), so every operation would trivially show as "never exercised" --
// not a real failure, just -list doing its job. Without this guard, a
// TestMain that calls this after m.Run() would make `go test -list` itself
// fail, which is exactly the command ci.yml runs to compute the handlers-1..4
// shards in the first place (`go test -list '^Test' ./server/http/handlers/...`).

// exist anywhere" -- the operation becomes ineligible in every shard, gets
// asserted on in none of them, and the build stays green while it is

// care about sharding or eligibility, it only asks whether the named test

// goBinary locates the "go" binary. It prefers runtime.GOROOT() (Sonar
// S4036 flags a bare PATH search; the GOROOT candidate avoids that in the
// common case), but that is best-effort, not a hard guarantee: a -trimpath
// build (this repo's own release builds use it, see Makefile) strips the
// embedded root entirely, and even a non-trimpath binary's runtime.GOROOT()
// still honors a GOROOT environment variable override at process start
// (https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#GOROOT, and empirically verified against this
// toolchain) -- so it is not immune to environment tampering, just keyed on
// a different variable than PATH. When the GOROOT candidate doesn't exist,
// this falls back to a PATH search so the check still works under
// -trimpath or an unusual GOROOT, matching the behavior this package had
// before the switch to runtime.GOROOT() (90f24f2c). SA1019: runtime.GOROOT

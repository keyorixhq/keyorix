// wire_actor_identity_forgery_guard_test.go — a guard for the bug class named
// and swept in the G80 documented-exception re-verification sweep
// (2026-08-25): a /system handler that reads an actor-shaped field straight
// off the wire body (invited_by, resolved_by, created_by, decided_by,
// approver_id, revoked_by) for an authorization decision or a persisted
// actor-identity field, instead of deriving it from the AUTHENTICATED caller
// (actorID(r) / requestActorKindAndID(r)). Two confirmed instances
// (CreateInvitationProxy's invited_by, UpdateAccessRequestProxy's
// resolved_by) were recorded FIXED under earlier PRs without ever touching
// this axis — this guard exists so a THIRD instance of the same shape can't
// land silently again.
//
// Modeled directly on raw_storage_bypass_guard_test.go's
// rawStorageBypassAllowlist / knownUnfixedRawStorageBypasses shape: flag
// every occurrence, require a reasoned entry in one of two lists, and fail on
// staleness (a listed handler that no longer reproduces, or no longer exists
// under /system).
//
// KNOWN BLIND SPOT, disclosed rather than hidden (matching this guard's own
// precedent's own documented gaps): this scan only catches `body.<Field>`
// where `body` is the DIRECT wire-decode variable. It does NOT see through an
// intermediate `.toModel()`/nested-struct hop — e.g.
// TransitionMachineIdentityStateProxy's actor field lives at
// `body.MachineIdentity.CreatedBy`, reached only via `body.MachineIdentity.
// toModel()`, never as a literal `body.CreatedBy` token. Those cases were
// found and fixed by hand during the sweep (see machine_identities_proxy.go's
// own doc comments); this guard cannot re-detect a regression in them and
// makes no claim to.

// reformatting alone can defeat it. Proven, not assumed, against a real
// defect this test found while being written: a handler whose signature
// spans multiple lines (the parameter list wrapped onto its own lines,
// rather than "func (recv *Type) Name(args) {" all on one line) used to
// vanish from handlerBodyText's capture entirely. depth tracking started on
// the funcRe-matched line and closed the moment that line's own brace count
// netted to zero — true for a split signature, since the opening "{" lands
// on a later line — stopping capture before the body, and any actor-field
// read in it, was ever seen. Confirmed red before the fix (this test failed

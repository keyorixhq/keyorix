// web/e2e/real/ui-dialog-viewport.spec.ts -- WEB-SWEEP-1: every dialog must be
// OPERABLE at a real laptop viewport, not merely present in the DOM.
//
// The failure this exists for (#2775): the shared Modal
// (web/src/components/ui/Modal.tsx) centres its panel with
// `-translate-y-1/2` and clips it with `overflow-hidden`, and had no height
// bound. A panel taller than the window therefore overflowed SYMMETRICALLY --
// half above, half below -- losing its header and its footer at the same time,
// with no scroll container to bring either back. Create User is 869px tall, so
// at 1280x720 and at 1440x800 its own submit button sat outside the viewport
// and the dialog could not be completed at all.
//
// Two complementary checks, because each misses what the other catches:
//
//   1. GEOMETRY, over every dialog in the inventory: the panel's box must lie
//      within the viewport. This is the family-wide guard -- it fails for any
//      dialog that grows past the window, including ones that do not exist yet,
//      which is the actual risk (Create User only became too tall as fields
//      were added to it).
//   2. The JOURNEY, on the one dialog that was broken: fill Create User in,
//      submit it, and see a real user land in the table. Geometry alone would
//      pass on a dialog that fits but whose submit is covered or disabled; only
//      driving it proves it is usable.
//
// Viewports are set explicitly rather than inherited: the whole point is a
// specific window height, so reading it from the Playwright device profile
// would make the assertion silently depend on a config file elsewhere.
//
// Run via scripts/e2e/web-real-smoke.sh, never directly.

// e2e-server: require_mfa=true
//
// web/e2e/real/mfa-required-first-login.spec.ts -- the first login of an account on a
// deployment that REQUIRES MFA (security.require_mfa: true), driven through the real UI
// against a real server (#2924 asked for this journey; #2933 added the route it ends on).
//
// The first line of this file is not a comment for humans: scripts/e2e/web-real-smoke.sh
// greps for exactly `// e2e-server: require_mfa=true` and, for the group that runs this
// file, writes `require_mfa: true` under `security:` in that group's keyorix.yaml before
// starting the server. Every other spec file boots with require_mfa unset (false), as it
// always did. One spec per group (MAX_SPECS_PER_GROUP=1), so the policy never leaks into
// another file's server. Keep that line first and exact when editing.
//
// THE USER JOURNEY (what a human does, and what each step proves):
//   1. A fresh admin (the group's bootstrap admin: it has no MFA) logs in on /login.
//      The password is right, so login succeeds and the SPA starts navigating to the
//      dashboard.
//   2. The dashboard's first API call is refused by EnforceMFAEnrollment with
//      403 {"error":"MFAEnrollmentRequired"}. client.ts's handle403 sends the browser to
//      /profile?tab=security&mfa=required (MFA_ENROLMENT_URL, #2933). We assert the URL
//      and that the Security tab shows the "Set up two-factor authentication to continue"
//      banner, NOT a generic "no permission" error.
//   3. Independently of the UI, a plain same-origin fetch of an authed API route returns
//      403 MFAEnrollmentRequired. This proves the server policy is really on, so step 2
//      is not satisfied by some other redirect, and gives step 6 something to flip.
//   4. The user clicks Enable, reads the setup key off the page, computes the current
//      TOTP code with the repo's own helper (helpers.ts totpCode), enters it with the
//      account password and clicks "Verify & enable". The recovery-codes dialog appears.
//   5. The user clicks Done. The Security tab now shows the Enabled badge and the banner
//      is gone.
//   6. The same fetch as step 3 no longer returns MFAEnrollmentRequired (the session that
//      enrolled is kept by ActivateMFA, and MFAEnabled is read per request), and
//      navigating to /dashboard stays on /dashboard and renders "Total Secrets".
//
// LOGIN BUDGET: the per-IP limit is 10 logins per 15 minutes per server. This group uses
// 2: the harness's own token login (used only for its health check, it seeds nothing in
// a require_mfa group because the policy would 403 the seeding calls) and the one UI
// login below. Nothing here calls apiLogin/createDedicatedUser: those would log in
// again, and would be 403'd or pointless under the policy.
//
// WHY THE SHARED ADMIN IS FINE HERE: the helpers' rule (never enable MFA on ADMIN_USERNAME)
// exists so other specs on the same server are not affected. This file is alone on its
// server, so enrolling its admin affects nobody else.

# check-closures.sh — fails if any security closure claim lacks a proving test
# that actually runs and passes IN THE ENVIRONMENT ITS ROW CLAIMS.
#
# Caught missing: G01 was recorded in REMEDIATION-STATUS.md as "merged, fully
# addressed — 8 of 8 members" for three weeks. Five members had landed; the other
# three sat on an unmerged branch (112b64ff). An adversarial review later
# re-exploited the gap live, spending a full exploit build to learn what this
# check learns in one second.
#
# Three design rules, each from a failure:
#
#   1. Verify by test, not by commit. This repo squash-merges, so
#      `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> origin/main` returns false for
#      every correctly landed PR — a check that always fails is as useless as one
#      that always passes, and more corrosive, because it teaches people to
#      ignore it. The landed_commit column is informational only.
#
#   2. PASS is not "did not fail". `go test -run` over a name that matches
#      nothing EXITS ZERO, and a gated test with no DSN does not appear in output
#      at all, not even as SKIP — that is how 13 Postgres lock sites stayed
#      "verified" for months on the path where every one is a no-op. So this
#      requires a literal `--- PASS: <name>` line and reports SKIP, no-match and
#      unrecognised output as three distinct failures.
#
#   3. A race that can only be demonstrated against a real multi-connection
#      Postgres (not SQLite/mocks) genuinely CANNOT produce a `--- PASS` line
#      in every environment — #1646 and #1780 were left OUT of this ledger
#      entirely for exactly that reason: rule 2 makes any Postgres-gated test
#      SKIP here (this script's own invocations never set KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN),
#      which rule 2 then treats as a failure, so a row for either could not be
#      added without either breaking CI or weakening rule 2 for everyone. Two
#      real closures with no row, indistinguishable from closures that never
#      happened — the ledger's completeness became a function of which
#      environment it runs in, not of what was actually fixed. The
#      `verification` column (see docs/security-closures.tsv's own header)
#      fixes this by making the row say which environment its proof requires,
#      so a skip can be judged against that claim instead of against a single
#      hardcoded assumption. This script still does not set the DSN itself —
#      .github/workflows/ci.yml's test-suite job (`core` leg) runs this SAME
#      script a second time, in the one job that already has Postgres — that
#      second run is what actually proves a pg-gated row; this rule just stops
#      the DSN-less run from reporting a false failure for it.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-closures.sh              # verify every row in the ledger
#   ./scripts/check-closures.sh --self-test  # prove the check can go red (and
#                                             # that it can go green honestly)

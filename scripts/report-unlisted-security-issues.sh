#!/bin/bash
# report-unlisted-security-issues.sh — lists closed GitHub issues carrying the
# `security` label that docs/security-closures.tsv does not cite by number in
# its `issue` column, so an omitted closure at least becomes VISIBLE instead
# of silently indistinguishable from a defect that never existed.
#
# THIS IS A REPORT, NOT A GATE. It never fails the build (see the bottom of
# this file) and it must not be mistaken for a completeness check. Two
# empirically-confirmed reasons:
#
#   1. The `security` label is under-applied in this repo, badly enough that
#      it would have missed the exact closures that motivated this script.
#      Checked 2026-09-08: #1646 and #1780 (the SoD cross-replica races this
#      ledger's pg-gated rows now cite) carry ZERO labels, and neither does
#      #1551 or #1572 -- two closures that were ALREADY correctly cited in
#      this ledger before this script existed. A detector keyed on this label
#      alone would not have caught the case it exists to catch.
#   2. GitHub's own structural "closed by PR" linkage isn't a reliable
#      fallback either: #1780 was closed via a PR body's "Closes #1780" (so it
#      has a real, structural closer), but #1646 was closed by hand despite
#      two PRs cross-referencing it (closer: null) -- the same issue, same
#      severity, same ledger, one traceable this way and one not.
#
# So an issue missing from this script's output is not proof nothing is
# owed -- it is proof only that this ONE weak signal didn't flag it. A `-` in
# the ledger's own `issue` column carries the identical caveat. Treat both as
# a floor, never a ceiling. There is no known reliable derivation source for
# "is this closed issue a security closure" in this repo today; shipping a
# hand-maintained list of issue numbers here would rot exactly the way the
# ledger itself did, so this queries live GitHub state instead of hardcoding
# one -- its only weakness is input-label completeness, not staleness.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/report-unlisted-security-issues.sh
#   Requires: gh CLI, authenticated (GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN), issues:read.

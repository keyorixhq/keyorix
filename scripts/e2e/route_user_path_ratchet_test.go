// route_user_path_ratchet.go closes a different gap than assertRouteCoverage
// (coverage.go): that check asserts every route is hit by THIS driver's own
// client or explicitly skip-listed. It says nothing about whether a route
// skip-listed here with a prose claim like "covered by journeyN" is actually
// true -- that claim was never machine-checked (QA-2 session, the bug class
// behind #2441/#2442: untested user paths that look covered on paper).
//
// This is a STATIC check -- no live server, just source text -- so it runs
// fast as part of TestAPISmoke_SQLite (see its call site) without adding a
// new CI job. It asks a narrower, sharper question than full route coverage:
// for every MUTATING or SECRET-DISCLOSING route (the two classes where an
// untested path is a real incident, not a cosmetic gap), is there at least
// one textual reference to it in ANY of the three places a real user path
// gets tested -- scripts/e2e/journeys (customer journeys), scripts/e2e's own
// api-smoke driver (THIS package), or web/e2e/real (Playwright against a
// real backend)?
//
// Deliberately conservative, same shape as check-api-contract.mjs's web-side
// twin (web/scripts/check-api-contract.mjs):
//   - Matching is LITERAL-PREFIX based (the route pattern's text up to its
//     first `{param}` segment must appear as a literal path prefix at some
//     scanned call site with a matching method). This can false-POSITIVE
//     (a call covering `/api/v1/secrets/` is credited to every route sharing
//     that prefix, e.g. both GET /api/v1/secrets/{id} and
//     GET /api/v1/secrets/{id}/acl) -- accepted because the failure mode this
//     check exists to catch is "nothing anywhere mentions this path at all",
//     not "exactly which sibling endpoint got exercised". It never produces
//     a false NEGATIVE from over-matching.
//   - web/e2e/real's Playwright specs mostly drive the UI (clicks/navigation)
//     rather than calling a path literal directly, so this scan's signal
//     there is weak by nature, not a limitation of the regex -- see its own
//     doc comment below. A route that's genuinely only covered via UI
//     interaction the spec file's text never names will show up as
//     uncovered here and need a knownUncoveredUserPaths entry, which is the
//     intended, honest fallback, not a bug in this checker.
//
// knownUncoveredUserPaths is the ratchet's allowlist, same shape as
// coverage.go's skipList and server/faultops's knownOpenTolerances: every
// pre-existing gap found by actually running this check against the repo
// today, named with a reason and (where one exists) an issue. A NEW gap not
// in this list fails the build.

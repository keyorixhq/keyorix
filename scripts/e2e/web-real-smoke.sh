# scripts/e2e/web-real-smoke.sh -- I4 (SESSION-I): drives the real web UI
# against a REAL keyorix-server backend (not web/e2e's existing mocked
# specs, which intercept every API call with canned responses -- see
# web/e2e/mocks.ts). Boots a real server the exact same way
# scripts/smoke.sh already proves works (admin init -> admin encryption
# init -> admin migrate -> start -> POST /system/init), points the Vite dev
# server at it via VITE_API_BASE_URL, and runs the Playwright specs under
# web/e2e/real/ (a separate Playwright config, playwright.config.real.ts,
# so this never touches the existing mock-based suite or its config).
#
# SESSION-WEB-E2E (2026-10-02/03): runs web/e2e/real/*.spec.ts in BUDGET
# GROUPS of at most MAX_SPECS_PER_GROUP files each, every group against its
# own freshly-booted server/DB, rather than one Playwright invocation
# covering every spec file against one shared backend.
# server/http/handlers/auth.go's reserveLoginAttempt enforces a shared
# per-IP budget of 10 login attempts (UI or API, success or fail) per 15
# minutes, backed by the DB -- fine for any one spec file alone, but the
# real-backend suite's total login volume across ALL files already exceeds
# it once summed (confirmed live: running every e2e/real/*.spec.ts file
# together in one invocation against one backend 429'd starting with the
# 11th login, mid-suite, with failures that look like broken tests but are
# actually an exhausted rate-limit budget -- nothing to do with any
# individual spec's correctness). A fresh SMOKE_DIR each group gets a fresh
# SQLite DB, which resets the counter (it's keyed in that DB, not wall-clock
# alone) -- so splitting into groups that each stay under budget, rather
# than trying to shave every file's login count down to fit one shared
# budget forever, is the fix that actually scales as more real-backend specs
# get added later instead of recreating this exact collision at some new
# file count.
#
# Groups are discovered dynamically (every e2e/real/*.spec.ts file that
# exists, chunked at MAX_SPECS_PER_GROUP) rather than a hardcoded file list,
# deliberately: a hardcoded list would be wrong -- and Playwright would error
# outright on a named file that doesn't exist -- on every individual PR
# branch that doesn't yet have every other in-flight real-backend spec file
# merged into it. Today's real per-file login counts run 2-5 each.
# MAX_SPECS_PER_GROUP=1 (2026-10-05, #2738): one spec file per freshly-booted
# server, so NO group's budget is ever a sum of per-file counts. The previous
# value of 2 was a hand-tuned number ("the worst real pairing today is 7"), and
# the comment it replaced was itself a hand-tuned 3 that had already broken
# once -- every added spec file re-opens the arithmetic, and the failure mode is
# a mid-suite 429 that reads as a broken test. Adding mfa-disable-dialog.spec.ts
# would have put the [mfa-disable-dialog + mfa-login] pairing at 9 plus the
# group's own 1 project-seeding login = the ceiling exactly, zero margin: the
# precise trap the old comment warned about, two spec files later. At 1 per
# group the binding constraint is a SINGLE file's own login count against the
# full budget, which a spec author can see while writing that file instead of
# having to know what else exists and how the alphabetical chunking lands.
# Today's worst single file is mfa-login at 6 (+1 seeding = 7 of 10).
# Cost: one server boot per spec file instead of per pair.
#
# Usage: scripts/e2e/web-real-smoke.sh [spec-file ...]
#   With no arguments: every e2e/real/*.spec.ts file (what CI runs).
#   With arguments: only those spec files, each still in its own group with its
#   own freshly-booted server -- for iterating on one spec without booting a
#   server for every other file. Paths are relative to web/ (e.g.
#   e2e/real/mfa-disable-dialog.spec.ts).
#   Requires: go, pnpm, a working `pnpm exec playwright install` (browsers
#   already cached locally is fine -- this script does not re-install them).

#
# 2026-10-05 (#2738): this harness used FIXED ports -- 18189+group for the server and
# 18190+group for the Vite dev server -- two ranges that INTERLEAVE, so group N+1's
# server port IS group N's web port. Two failures follow from that, both confirmed live
# on this machine:
#
#   1. A second concurrent run of this script on the same host collides outright. The
#      colliding server then fails to bind while the /health poll SUCCEEDS, because the
#      other run's server answers it -- so the script sails past its own
#      "did-it-start?" gate and sends the rest of the group's setup, including POST
#      /system/init, to a stranger's server. (Harmless in the event: /system/init on an
#      already-initialised system is a no-op. The next call, /auth/login with this run's
#      own password, 401s against that other admin, and the failure looks like a broken
#      spec.)
#   2. Any lingering dev server from group N makes group N+1's server fail to bind the
#      same way. MAX_SPECS_PER_GROUP=1 multiplies the number of groups, so this went
#      from unlikely to likely.
#
# Probing for a free port cannot be atomic (something may grab it between the probe and
# the bind), but it removes both deterministic collisions. Uses bash's own /dev/tcp
# rather than nc, so it needs nothing extra installed.

# seed_demo_data puts realistic content behind every page a real-backend spec
# visits (WEB-SWEEP-1). Before this, each group seeded one empty project, so
# every list page rendered its empty state and a spec could only ever assert
# "the shell rendered" -- a page that silently drops its rows, or a role gate
# that hides content it should show, looks identical to a correctly-rendered
# empty list.
#
# Two API shapes here are easy to get wrong and are spelled out rather than
# left to be rediscovered:
#
#   * POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/members grants a SCOPED ROLE. A project role
#     alone does NOT satisfy the global-scope permission gates most list
#     endpoints use (server/http/router.go gates GET /api/v1/projects with
#     RequirePermission, not RequireScopedPermission), which is exactly why the
#     least-privilege persona below is a genuinely restricted view and not just
#     a second admin.
#   * POST /api/v1/secrets/{id}/share requires the SHARER to be a live member
#     of the secret's project (internal/core/sharing.go's
#     requireLiveOwnerAuthority) as well as the recipient. Creating a project
#     does not make the creator a member of it -- hence the explicit
#     self-membership grant before any share call.
#
# Every call is best-effort on purpose: a seeding failure must not fail the
# suite before Playwright has run, because an empty page is a far clearer
# diagnostic in a spec's own assertion than a curl exit code buried in this
# script's output. Each step echoes what it did.

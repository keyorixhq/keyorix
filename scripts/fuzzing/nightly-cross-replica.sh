#!/usr/bin/env bash
# nightly-cross-replica.sh — the nightly long run for the two-replica
# cross-replica invariant fuzzer (GUARD-5 item 4).
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT PART OF THE SHARED FUZZ RIG
#
# Every other Keyorix fuzz target runs under the external fuzz-harness runner
# (see README.md: one standardized runner across Keyorix/DashDiag/third-party
# rigs, crashers to the private corpus, never a public issue). This one cannot:
# FuzzCrossReplicaInvariants needs a real multi-connection PostgreSQL server,
# skips outright without KEYORIX_TEST_PG_DSN, and would therefore report a
# perfect clean run forever on the generic rig — the worst possible failure
# mode for a fuzz target. So it gets its own unit with its own throwaway
# Postgres, and everything else about it (private-corpus-only crashers, one
# ntfy line per NEW failure, no public disclosure) deliberately matches the
# shared rig's conventions rather than inventing new ones.
#
# WHAT IT RUNS, IN ORDER
#
#   1. the ordering SWEEP once (KEYORIX_INTERLEAVE_SWEEP=1): ~3 minutes, and
#      it is the only thing that runs the full 180-run interleaving
#      enumeration anywhere. Cheap relative to the fuzz budget, and it is the
#      discovery half of this rig — the per-issue regression tests in CI are
#      the guard half.
#   2. the fuzz target itself for $FUZZTIME.
#
# The sweep runs FIRST on purpose. If it fails, that is a specific, named,
# reproducible finding (a (pair, ordering) with no ledger row), which is worth
# alerting on immediately rather than after four hours of fuzzing.
#
# HOST COEXISTENCE
#
# pve01 is shared with the benchmark sessions, whose numbers a parallel CPU
# load silently corrupts. /root/PVE-BENCH-LOCK is the convention. This script
# is the polite party:
#   - it SKIPS (exit 0, no alert) if the lock exists when it starts. A skipped
#     night is not a failure and must not page anyone.
#   - it also WATCHES the lock while running and aborts cleanly if a benchmark
#     session claims it mid-run. Checking only at startup would be useless:
#     the run is four hours long and the benchmark sessions start whenever
#     their operator is awake.
#
# ALERTING
#
# One ntfy line per NEW failure, deduplicated by a marker file keyed on the
# failure's own fingerprint — so a crasher that reproduces every night for a
# week pages once, not seven times. A repeat is still recorded in the log.
# Same no-secrets-in-argv pattern as scripts/dast/lib-alert.sh and
# scripts/mutation-testing/notify-summary.sh: the topic URL goes into a
# `curl -K` config file, never into the command line, so it never appears in
# `ps`.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  clean run, or skipped because the host lock was held
#   1  a failure was found (sweep finding, or a fuzz crasher)
#   2  the rig itself is broken (no Postgres, no checkout, bad config)
set -euo pipefail

# --- configuration -----------------------------------------------------------
# Everything below is overridable from the systemd EnvironmentFile
# (/etc/keyorix-xreplica/config.env — see config.env.example).

# KEYORIX_REPO: the rig's own checkout, reset to origin/main before each run.
: "${KEYORIX_REPO:=/opt/keyorix-xreplica/keyorix}"
# STATE_DIR: logs and alert-dedup markers.
: "${STATE_DIR:=/opt/keyorix-xreplica/state}"
# KEYORIX_REF: the ref to test. origin/main is the only value the nightly
# should ever use -- the point of the rig is to tell you about main. It is a
# variable solely so an install can be smoke-tested against a branch before
# that branch merges (see docs/fuzzing/cross-replica-nightly.md). Without
# that, the first time anyone watches this script run would be the first
# night it mattered, and a guard nobody has watched fail is not a guard.
: "${KEYORIX_REF:=origin/main}"
# RUN_SWEEP / SWEEP_TIMEOUT: whether to run the ordering sweep before the fuzz
# run, and the `go test -timeout` budget for it. The sweep is ~175 forced
# interleavings and its wall-clock is dominated by Postgres round-trips, so it
# is minutes, not seconds. RUN_SWEEP=0 is for smoke-testing the rest of this
# script without paying for it -- not for routine use: the sweep is the only
# place the full interleaving enumeration runs anywhere, and turning it off
# permanently would leave this unit doing nothing CI does not already do.
: "${RUN_SWEEP:=1}"
: "${SWEEP_TIMEOUT:=90m}"
# FUZZTIME: the brief asks for a 4-hour run in a 01:00-05:00 window. 3h45m,
# not 4h, is deliberate: the window is four hours WIDE, and the run also has
# to pay for the container start, the schema migration, the ~3-minute ordering
# sweep, and the corpus push. A literal 4h fuzztime starting at 01:00 would
# end after 05:00 and collide with exactly the benchmark window this whole
# lock dance exists to protect. Raise it only if the timer moves earlier.
: "${FUZZTIME:=3h45m}"
# PG_CONTAINER / PG_IMAGE: the dedicated Postgres. Dedicated, not shared:
# the fuzzer creates an isolated schema per run but a shared server's other
# work would still contend for its connection slots and lock table, and a
# cross-replica race test is exactly the thing that mis-measures under that.
: "${PG_CONTAINER:=keyorix-xreplica-pg}"
: "${PG_IMAGE:=postgres:16}"
: "${PG_PASSWORD:=xreplica}"
# HOST_LOCK: the pve01 benchmark lock. Set to empty to disable the check
# (correct on a box that runs no benchmarks).
: "${HOST_LOCK:=/root/PVE-BENCH-LOCK}"
# LOCK_POLL_SECONDS: how often to re-check the host lock while running.
: "${LOCK_POLL_SECONDS:=60}"
# CORPUS_REPO: the PRIVATE corpus checkout new crashers are pushed to. Never
# a public repo — an unfixed own-code race must not be disclosed before its
# fix (README.md, REPORT_MODE=private).
: "${CORPUS_REPO:=/opt/keyorix-xreplica/fuzz-corpus}"
: "${CORPUS_SUBDIR:=corpus/internal-core/FuzzCrossReplicaInvariants}"
# NTFY_TOPIC: full topic URL. Unset = silent no-op (same as lib-alert.sh).
: "${NTFY_TOPIC:=}"
# KNOWN_OPEN_CLASSES: space-separated issue numbers whose invariant class is a
# KNOWN-OPEN bug on main. A crasher whose violation lines name only these is
# logged, kept, and NOT alerted on.
#
# This exists because of a real measurement, not in anticipation: the first
# smoke run of this script found #2649 by blind fuzzing in SEVEN SECONDS.
# Before #2768 fixed the fuzzer's world, that whole op family could not
# execute at all and the invariant was vacuous; now it is reachable
# immediately. With the fix stack (#2664..#2675) still open, an unsuppressed
# rig would spend every night re-reporting the same four known bugs and would
# never get far enough into the input space to find a new one -- and the
# recipient would learn to ignore the topic, which is how a real second
# finding gets missed.
#
# Same discipline as server/faultops' knownOpenTolerances (COMMON-RULES):
# scope it to the specific open issue, name the issue, and DELETE the entry in
# the PR that fixes it. A suppression that outlives its bug silences a
# regression forever. The sweep step is NOT suppressed -- only the fuzz step --
# because the sweep has its own per-(pair, ordering) ledger in-tree.

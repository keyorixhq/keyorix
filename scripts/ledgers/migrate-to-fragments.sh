# migrate-to-fragments.sh — moves every row of the dual-read ledgers out of
# the flat legacy TSV and into one-row fragment files under <name>.d/.
#
# Why: on 2026-10-03/04 about 20 approved PRs repeatedly fell out of the merge
# queue on conflicts, nearly all in a few append-only ledgers. Every reader of
# these ledgers already reads legacy TSV + <name>.d/*.tsv (C-MERGE-FRICTION),
# so new rows can go into fragments today without touching the shared file.
# This script finishes the job by moving the EXISTING rows — which rewrites
# the shared files every open PR touches, so it must only be run by the
# coordinator, in a quiet merge window, never on a feature branch.
#
# Ledgers migrated (key column = column 1):
#   docs/adr-conformance-enforced.tsv   -> docs/adr-conformance-enforced.d/   (scripts/check-adr-conformance.sh)
#   docs/review-coverage.tsv            -> docs/review-coverage.d/            (scripts/check-review-coverage.sh)
#   docs/check-then-act-lock-exempt.tsv -> docs/check-then-act-lock-exempt.d/ (internal/core TestCheckThenActLockGuard_*)
# NOT migrated: docs/security-closures.tsv — it is already GENERATED from
# docs/security-closures.d/ (scripts/gen-security-closures-tsv.sh).
#
# What it does, per ledger:
#   - comment and blank lines stay in the legacy file (the header documents
#     the columns; the readers still require the legacy file to exist);
#   - each data row moves, byte-for-byte, to <name>.d/<fragment_name(key)>.tsv;
#   - fragment_name: '/' -> '__', '(' ')' '*' dropped, a bare '.' -> '_root'.
#
# Safety:
#   - Refuses (exit 1, NOTHING written for ANY ledger) on: a duplicate key in
#     the legacy file, two keys mapping to one fragment name, or an existing
#     fragment file with DIFFERENT content than the row it would receive.
#   - Idempotent: an existing fragment with IDENTICAL content is accepted (the
#     legacy row is just dropped), and a second run finds no rows -> no-op.
#   - Deterministic: output depends only on the input files.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ledgers/migrate-to-fragments.sh            # migrate in place
#   scripts/ledgers/migrate-to-fragments.sh --dry-run  # print the plan, write nothing
#   LEDGER_ROOT=/some/checkout scripts/ledgers/migrate-to-fragments.sh   # operate on another tree
# Afterwards: run the three readers (see the README.md in each .d/ directory)
# and commit the legacy files + new fragments together.
